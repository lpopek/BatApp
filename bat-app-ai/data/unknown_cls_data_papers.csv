1,Brown adipose tissue and lipid metabolism,"Purpose of review:
        
      
      This article explores how the interplay between lipid metabolism and thermogenic adipose tissues enables proper physiological adaptation to cold environments in rodents and humans. Recent findings:
        
      
      Cold exposure triggers systemic changes in lipid metabolism, which increases fatty acid delivery to brown adipose tissue (BAT) by various routes. Next to fatty acids generated intracellularly by de-novo lipogenesis or by lipolysis at lipid droplets, brown adipocytes utilize fatty acids released by white adipose tissue (WAT) for adaptive thermogenesis. WAT-derived fatty acids are internalized directly by BAT, or indirectly after hepatic conversion to very low-density lipoproteins and acylcarnitines. In the postprandial state, chylomicrons hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase - activated specifically in thermogenic adipocytes - are the predominant fatty acid source. Cholesterol-enriched chylomicron remnants and HDL generated by intravascular lipolysis in BAT are cleared more rapidly by the liver, explaining the antiatherogenic effects of BAT activation. Notably, increased cholesterol flux and elevated hepatic synthesis of bile acids under cold exposure further promote BAT-dependent thermogenesis. Summary:
        
      
      Although pathways providing fatty acids for activated BAT have been identified, more research is needed to understand the integration of lipid metabolism in BAT, WAT and liver, and to determine the relevance of BAT for human energy metabolism.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']","Joerg Heeren, Ludger Scheja, ",Current opinion in lipidology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29718003

3,Viral Manipulations of the Cullin-RING Ubiquitin Ligases,"Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are efficient and diverse toolsets of the cells to regulate almost every biological process. However, these characteristics have also been usurped by many viruses to optimize for their replication. CRLs are often at the forefront of the arms races in the coevolution of viruses and hosts. Here we review the modes of actions and functional consequences of viral manipulations of host cell CRLs. We also discuss the therapeutic applications to target these viral manipulations for treating viral infections.","['1 MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Beijing Frontier Research Center for Biological Structures, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', '2 MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Beijing Frontier Research Center for Biological Structures, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. xutan@tsinghua.edu.cn.']","Ying Liu, Xu Tan, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,NO_DATE,CRL; Cullins; Degradation; Ubiquitination; Virus infection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898224
4,Thermoregulation and the ultradian basic rest-activity cycle,"Daily life involves interactions with the external environment. In rats these apparently spontaneous interactions, often associated with the search for food, alternate with periods of rest in both the dark and light periods of the 24-hour day. Kleitman, in whose laboratory rapid eye movement sleep was discovered, referred to the temporal pattern as ""the basic rest-activity cycle."" The active periods of the basic rest-activity cycle occur approximately every 1-2 hours in an irregular stochastic pattern that has been described (perhaps unhelpfully) as ultradian rhythmicity. Both the spontaneous interactions and those evoked by salient, potentially threatening environmental events are accompanied by increases in brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature of approximately 1°C. The heat produced in BAT contributes to associated increases in the temperature of the brain (approximately 0.8°C) and the body (approximately 0.6°C). These temperature changes require extension of the conventional ""homeostasis"" framework of temperature regulation. They may function to facilitate the cognitive processing that underlies the vital decision making necessary for safe and effective interaction with the external environment.","['1 Department of Human Physiology, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

5,An overview of viral infections of the nervous system in the immunosuppressed,"Several viruses have the capacity to cause serious infections of the nervous system in patients who are immunosuppressed. Individuals may be immunosuppressed because of primary inherited immunodeficiency, secondary immunodeficiency due to particular diseases such as malignancy, administration of immunosuppressant drugs or organ or bone marrow transplantation. The viruses capable of such opportunistic infection of the nervous system include herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), Human Herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6), JC virus (JCV), enterovirus, measles virus and Covid-19. In most cases it seems likely that immunological defence mechanisms in the immunosuppressed are deficient which creates a suitable environment for certain viruses to become opportunistic in the nervous and other systems. Further research is required both to understand these opportunistic mechanisms in more detail and also to determine how many virus infections are modified by specific inborn errors of immunological responses.","['1 Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1QH, Scotland, UK.

7,UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent metabolic changes induced by acute cold exposure in brown adipose tissue of mice,"Background:
        
      
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a site of metabolic thermogenesis mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and represents a target for a therapeutic intervention in obesity. Cold exposure activates UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT and causes drastic changes in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism; however, the relationship between these metabolic changes and UCP1-mediated thermogenesis is not fully understood. Methods:
        
      
      We conducted metabolomic and GeneChip array analyses of BAT after 4-h exposure to cold temperature (10 °C) in wild-type (WT) and UCP1-KO mice. Results:
        
      
      Cold exposure largely increased metabolites of the glycolysis pathway and lactic acid levels in WT, but not in UCP1-KO, mice, indicating that aerobic glycolysis is enhanced as a consequence of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. GeneChip array analysis of BAT revealed that there were 2865 genes upregulated by cold exposure in WT mice, and 838 of these were upregulated and 74 were downregulated in UCP1-KO mice. Pathway analysis revealed the enrichment of genes involved in fatty acid (FA) β oxidation and triglyceride (TG) synthesis in both WT and UCP1-KO mice, suggesting that these metabolic pathways were enhanced by cold exposure independently of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. FA and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were enhanced only in UCP1-KO mice. Cold exposure also significantly increased the BAT content of proline, tryptophan, and phenylalanine amino acids in both WT and UCP1-KO mice. In WT mice, cold exposure significantly increased glutamine content and enhanced the expression of genes related to glutamine metabolism. Surprisingly, aspartate was almost completely depleted after cold exposure in UCP1-KO mice. Gene expression analysis suggested that aspartate was actively utilized after cold exposure both in WT and UCP1-KO mice, but it was replenished from intracellular N-acetyl-aspartate in WT mice. Conclusions:
        
      
      These results revealed that cold exposure induces UCP1-mediated thermogenesis-dependent glucose utilization and UCP1-independent active lipid metabolism in BAT. In addition, cold exposure largely affects amino acid metabolism in BAT, especially UCP1-dependently enhances glutamine utilization. These results contribute a comprehensive understanding of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis-dependent and thermogenesis-independent metabolism in BAT.","['1 Laboratory of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.

8,Programming mediated by fatty acids affects uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in brown adipose tissue,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has recently been given more attention for the part it plays in obesity. BAT can generate great amounts of heat through thermogenesis by the activation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), which can be regulated by many environmental factors such as diet. Moreover, the build-up of BAT relates to maternal nutritional changes during pregnancy and lactation. However, at present, there is a limited number of studies looking at maternal nutrition and BAT development, and it seems that the research trend in this field has been considerably declining since the 1980s. There is much to discover yet about the role of different fatty acids on the development of BAT and the activation of UCP-1 during the fetal and the postnatal periods of life. A better understanding of the impact of nutritional intervention on the epigenetic regulation of BAT could lead to new preventive care for metabolic diseases such as obesity. It is important to know in which circumstances lipids could programme BAT during pregnancy and lactation. The modification of maternal dietary fatty acids, amount and composition, during pregnancy and lactation might be a promising strategy for the prevention of obesity in the offspring and future generations.","['1 1Programa de Pós Graduação em Alimentos Nutrição e Saúde,Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP),Santos,São Paulo,Brazil.', '2 2Departamento de Biociências,Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP),Santos, São Paulo,Brazil.']","Perla P Argentato, Helena de Cássia César, Débora Estadella, Luciana P Pisani, ",The British journal of nutrition,NO_DATE,BA brown adipocytes; BAT brown adipose tissue; UCP-1 uncoupling protein 1; Brown adipose tissue; Fatty acids; Fetal programming; Obesity; Uncoupling protein 1.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30176958
9,Evolutionary design principles in metabolism,"Microorganisms are ubiquitous and adapt to various dynamic environments to sustain growth. These adaptations accumulate, generating new traits forming the basis of evolution. Organisms adapt at various levels, such as gene regulation, signalling, protein-protein interactions and metabolism. Of these, metabolism forms the integral core of an organism for maintaining the growth and function of a cell. Therefore, studying adaptations in metabolic networks is crucial to understand the emergence of novel metabolic capabilities. Metabolic networks, composed of enzyme-catalysed reactions, exhibit certain repeating paradigms or design principles that arise out of different selection pressures. In this review, we discuss the design principles that are known to exist in metabolic networks, such as functional redundancy, modularity, flux coupling and exaptations. We elaborate on the studies that have helped gain insights highlighting the interplay of these design principles and adaptation. Further, we discuss how evolution plays a role in exploiting such paradigms to enhance the robustness of organisms. Looking forward, we predict that with the availability of ever-increasing numbers of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic genomic sequences, novel design principles will be identified, expanding our understanding of these paradigms shaped by varied evolutionary processes.","['1 1 Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai 600036 , India.', '2 2 Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE), Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai 600036 , India.', '3 3 Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI), Indian Institute of Technology Madras , Chennai 600036 , India.']","Gayathri Sambamoorthy, Himanshu Sinha, Karthik Raman, ",Proceedings.

10,The molecular clock and evolutionary timescales,"The molecular clock provides a valuable means of estimating evolutionary timescales from genetic and biochemical data. Proposed in the early 1960s, it was first applied to amino acid sequences and immunological measures of genetic distances between species. The molecular clock has undergone considerable development over the years, and it retains profound relevance in the genomic era. In this mini-review, we describe the history of the molecular clock, its impact on evolutionary theory, the challenges brought by evidence of evolutionary rate variation among species, and the statistical models that have been developed to account for these heterogeneous rates of genetic change. We explain how the molecular clock can be used to infer rates and timescales of evolution, and we list some of the key findings that have been obtained when molecular clocks have been applied to genomic data. Despite the numerous challenges that it has faced over the decades, the molecular clock continues to offer the most effective method of resolving the details of the evolutionary timescale of the Tree of Life.","['1 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', '2 Key Laboratory of Zoological Systematics and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', '3 School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia simon.ho@sydney.edu.au.']","Arong Luo, Simon Y W Ho, ",Biochemical Society transactions,2018,Tree of Life; evolutionary rate; genomics; molecular dating; molecular evolution; timescale.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30154097
11,"Adaptation, speciation and extinction in the Anthropocene","Humans have dramatically altered the planet over the course of a century, from the acidity of our oceans to the fragmentation of our landscapes and the temperature of our climate. Species find themselves in novel environments, within communities assembled from never before encountered mixtures of invasives and natives. The speed with which the biotic and abiotic environment of species has changed has already altered the evolutionary trajectory of species, a trend that promises to escalate. In this article, I reflect upon this altered course of evolution. Human activities have reshaped selection pressures, favouring individuals that better survive in our built landscapes, that avoid our hunting and fishing, and that best tolerate the species that we have introduced. Human-altered selection pressures have also modified how organisms live and move through the landscape, and even the nature of reproduction and genome structure. Humans are also shaping selection pressures at the species level, and I discuss how species traits are affecting both extinction and speciation rates in the Anthropocene.","['1 Department of Zoology, Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z4 otto@zoology.ubc.ca.']","Sarah P Otto, ",Proceedings.

12,"Richard Dickerson, Molecular Clocks, and Rates of Protein Evolution","Proteins approximately behave as molecular clocks, accumulating amino acid replacements at a more or less constant rate. Nonetheless, each protein displays a characteristic rate of evolution: whereas some proteins remain largely unaltered over large periods of time, others can rapidly accumulate amino acid replacements. An article by Richard Dickerson, published in the first issue of the Journal of Molecular Evolution (J Mol Evol 1:26-45, 1971), described the first analysis in which the rates of evolution of many proteins were compared, and the differences were interpreted in the light of their function. When comparing the sequences of fibrinopeptides, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c of different species, he observed a linear relationship between the number of amino acid replacements and divergence time. Remarkably, fibrinopeptides had evolved fast, cytochrome c had evolved slowly, and hemoglobin exhibited an intermediate rate of evolution. As the Journal of Molecular Evolution celebrates its 50th anniversary, I highlight this landmark article and reflect on its impact on the field of Molecular Evolution.","['1 Department of Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, 1664 N.

13,"Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT)-Development, Validity, and Reliability","This paper introduces a new definition for burnout and investigates the psychometric properties of the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT). In a prior qualitative study, 49 practitioners were interviewed about their conceptualization of burnout (part 1). Using a dialectical approach, four core dimensions-exhaustion, mental distance, and impaired emotional and cognitive impairment-and three secondary dimensions-depressed mood, psychological distress, and psychosomatic complaints-emerged, which constitute the basis of the BAT. In the second study, the psychometric characteristics of the BAT were investigated in a representative sample of 1500 Flemish employees, focusing on factorial validity, reliability, and construct validity, respectively. Results demonstrate the assumed four-factor structure for the core dimensions, which is best represented by one general burnout factor. Contrary to expectations, instead of a three-factor structure, a two-factor structure was found for the secondary dimensions. Furthermore, the BAT and its subscales show adequate reliability. Convergent validity and discriminant validity with other burnout measures-including the MBI and OLBI-was demonstrated, as well as discriminant validity with other well-being constructs, such as work engagement and workaholism.","['1 Research Group Work, Organizational and Personnel Psychology (WOPP), O2L, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', '2 Department of Social and Organizational Psychology, Utrecht University, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.', '3 Optentia Research Focus Area, North-West University, Vanderbijlpark 1900, South Africa.']","Wilmar B Schaufeli, Steffie Desart, Hans De Witte, ",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020,Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT); burnout; conceptualization; scale development; validation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33352940
14,Innate immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2: Comparison with SARS-CoV,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes Covid-19 pandemic disease with severe respiratory illness. Multiple strategies enable SARS-CoV-2 to eventually overcome antiviral innate immune mechanisms which are important components of viral pathogenesis. This review considers several mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 innate immune evasion including suppression of IFN-α/β production at the earliest stage of infection, mechanisms that exhaust natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, overstimulation of NLRP3 inflammasome and induction of a cytokine storm. A comparison with SARS-CoV is made. Greater knowledge of these and other immune evasion tactics may provide us with improved possibilities for research into this novel deadly virus.","['1 Laboratory of Immunohematology and Cellular Therapy, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Mohammed First University, Oujda, Morocco.', '2 Laboratory of Immunology, Mohammed VI Hospital, Oujda, Morocco.']","Abdellatif Bouayad, ",Reviews in medical virology,NO_DATE,IFN-α/β; NLRP3 inflammasome; SARS-CoV-2; coronaviruses; immune evasion; innate immunity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734714

17,Viral strategies for triggering and manipulating mitophagy,"Viral infection causes many physiological alterations in the host cell, and many of these alterations can affect the host mitochondrial network, including mitophagy induction. A substantial amount of literature has been generated that advances our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and several viruses. Some viruses trigger mitophagy directly, and indirectly and control the mitophagic process via different strategies. This enables viruses to promote persistent infection and attenuate the innate immune responses. In this review, we discuss the events of virus-regulated mitophagy and the functional relevance of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of viral infection and disease.

18,Postprandial Oxidative Metabolism of Human Brown Fat Indicates Thermogenesis,"Human studies suggest that a meal elevates glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, in postprandial state the thermogenic activity and the metabolism of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in BAT remain unclear. Using indirect calorimetry combined with positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), we showed that whole-body and BAT thermogenesis (oxygen consumption) increases after the ingestion of a mixed carbohydrate-rich meal, to the same extent as in cold stress. Postprandial NEFA uptake into BAT is minimal, possibly due to elevated plasma insulin inhibiting lipolysis. However, the variation in postprandial NEFA uptake is linked to BAT thermogenesis. We identified several genes participating in lipid metabolism to be expressed at higher levels in BAT compared with white fat in postprandial state, and to be positively correlated with BAT UCP1 expression. These findings suggest that substrates preferred by BAT in postprandial state are glucose or LPL-released NEFAs due to insulin stimulation.","['1 Turku PET Centre, Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland.', '2 Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.', '3 Chair of Molecular Nutritional Medicine, Else Kröner-Fresenius Center, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany.', ""4 University Côte d'Azur, CNRS, Inserm, iBV, Nice, France."", '5 Chair of Molecular Nutritional Medicine, Else Kröner-Fresenius Center, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany; ZIEL - Institute for Food and Health, Technical University of Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany.', '6 Turku PET Centre, Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Department of Chemistry, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Accelerator Laboratory, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.', '7 Turku PET Centre, Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Department of Endocrinology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', '8 Turku PET Centre, Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520 Turku, Finland; Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Kuopio, Finland.

19,Insect-specific virus evolution and potential effects on vector competence,"The advancement in high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools has spurred a new age of viral discovery. Arthropods is the largest group of animals and has shown to be a major reservoir of different viruses, including a group known as insect-specific viruses (ISVs). The majority of known ISVs have been isolated from mosquitoes and shown to belong to viral families associated with animal arbovirus pathogens, such as Flaviviridae, Togaviridae and Phenuiviridae. These insect-specific viruses have a strict tropism and are unable to replicate in vertebrate cells, these properties are interesting for many reasons. One is that these viruses could potentially be utilised as biocontrol agents using a similar strategy as for Wolbachia. Mosquitoes infected with the viral agent could have inferior vectorial capacity of arboviruses resulting in a decrease of circulating arboviruses of public health importance. Moreover, insect-specific viruses are thought to be ancestral to arboviruses and could be used to study the evolution of the switch from single-host to dual-host. In this review, we discuss new discoveries and hypothesis in the field of arboviruses and insect-specific viruses.","['1 Section of Virology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7028, 750 07, Uppsala, Sweden.', '2 Section of Virology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7028, 750 07, Uppsala, Sweden. anne-lie.blomstrom@slu.se.']","Pontus Öhlund, Hanna Lundén, Anne-Lie Blomström, ",Virus genes,NO_DATE,Arbovirus; Evolution; Insect-specific virus; Vector competence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30632016
20,Virus Maturation,"A virus particle consists of a genome contained within a protein shell. This shell (the capsid) plays multiple roles throughout the infectious cycle, from genome protection to host recognition to successful genome delivery. When capsids first assemble in the cell, most often an initial product is obtained that has not achieved its fully infectious form. To do so, it must undergo a final process called maturation. Virus maturation entails conformational and stability changes. These changes are often driven by proteolytic cleavages, and their main purpose is to ensure successful delivery of the virus genome to a new host cell. Recent advances in molecular, structural, and physical virology techniques are providing a wealth of detailed information and new points of view to understand the principles of virus maturation. Evidence showing that viral capsids are built with a limited set of structural solutions has prompted a new virus classification in structural lineages deriving from a few initial ancestors. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge on maturation for the main virus structural lineages, as well as for other relevant viruses not assigned to any particular lineage yet.","['1 Department of Macromolecular Structure, Centro Nacional de Biotecnología (CNB-CSIC), Madrid, Spain. carmen@cnb.csic.es.']","Carmen San Martín, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,NO_DATE,Capsid; Maturation; Scaffold; Stability; Uncoating; Virus assembly; Virus proteases; Virus structure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31317499

22,Autophagy during viral infection - a double-edged sword,"Autophagy is a powerful tool that host cells use to defend against viral infection. Double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, deliver trapped viral cargo to the lysosome for degradation. Specifically, autophagy initiates an innate immune response by cooperating with pattern recognition receptor signalling to induce interferon production. It also selectively degrades immune components associated with viral particles. Following degradation, autophagy coordinates adaptive immunity by delivering virus-derived antigens for presentation to T lymphocytes. However, in an ongoing evolutionary arms race, viruses have acquired the potent ability to hijack and subvert autophagy for their benefit. In this Review, we focus on the key regulatory steps during viral infection in which autophagy is involved and discuss the specific molecular mechanisms that diverse viruses use to repurpose autophagy for their life cycle and pathogenesis.","['1 Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA. jaeujung@med.usc.edu.']","Younho Choi, James W Bowman, Jae U Jung, ",Nature reviews.

23,SARS-CoV-2 host diversity: An update of natural infections and experimental evidence,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic threat. This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dogs might be secondary hosts during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne routes. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for the COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic. In this review, we summarize the natural cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with the latest researches conducted in this field. This review will be helpful to think insights of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, spread, and demand for seroprevalence studies, especially in companion animals.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.

25,Brown adipose tissue-derived exosomes mitigate the metabolic syndrome in high fat diet mice,"The ever-increasing incidence of obesity and related disorders impose serious challenges on public health worldwide. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has strong capacity for promoting energy expenditure and has shown great potential in treating obesity. Exosomes are nanovesicles that share the characteristics of their donor cells. Whether BAT derived exosomes (BAT-Exos) might exert similar metabolic benefits on obesity is worthy of investigation. Methods: Obese mice were established by high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding and were treated with Seum-Exos or BAT-Exos isolated from young healthy mice. Blood glucose, glucose tolerance and blood lipids were tested in mice with indicated treatments. Histology examinations were performed on adipose tissue, liver and heart by HE staining and/or Oil Red O staining. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate cardiac function of mice. In vivo distribution of exosomes was analyzed by fluorescence labeling and imaging and in vitro effects of exosomes were evaluated by cell metabolism analysis. Protein contents of BAT-Exos were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Results: The results showed that BAT-Exos reduced the body weight, lowered blood glucose and alleviated lipid accumulation in HFD mice independently of food intake. Echocardiography revealed that the abnormal cardiac functions of HFD mice were significantly restored after treatment with BAT-Exos. Cell metabolism analysis showed that treatment with BAT-Exos significantly promoted oxygen consumption in recipient cells. Protein profiling of exosomes demonstrated that BAT-Exos were rich in mitochondria components and involved in catalytic processes. Conclusions: Collectively, our study showed that BAT-Exos significantly mitigated the metabolic syndrome in HFD mice. Detailed elucidation of the reactive molecules and mechanism of action would provide new insights in combating obesity and related disorders.","[""1 Department of Ultrasound Diagnostics, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""2 The State Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China.""]","Xueying Zhou, Zhelong Li, Meihao Qi, Ping Zhao, Yunyou Duan, Guodong Yang, Lijun Yuan, ",Theranostics,2020,Exosomes; brown adipose tissue; cardiovascular diseases; cell-free therapy; obesity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32724466
26,Innate Immune Evasion by Human Respiratory RNA Viruses,"The impact of respiratory virus infections on the health of children and adults can be very significant. Yet, in contrast to most other childhood infections as well as other viral and bacterial diseases, prophylactic vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against viral respiratory infections are either still not available, or provide only limited protection. Given the widespread prevalence, a general lack of natural sterilizing immunity, and/or high morbidity and lethality rates of diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, this difficult situation is a genuine societal challenge. A thorough understanding of the virus-host interactions during these respiratory infections will most probably be pivotal to ultimately meet these challenges. This review attempts to provide a comparative overview of the knowledge about an important part of the interaction between respiratory viruses and their host: the arms race between host innate immunity and viral innate immune evasion. Many, if not all, viruses, including the respiratory viruses listed above, suppress innate immune responses to gain a window of opportunity for efficient virus replication and setting-up of the infection. The consequences for the host's immune response are that it is often incomplete, delayed or diminished, or displays overly strong induction (after the delay) that may cause tissue damage. The affected innate immune response also impacts subsequent adaptive responses, and therefore viral innate immune evasion often undermines fully protective immunity. In this review, innate immune responses relevant for respiratory viruses with an RNA genome will briefly be summarized, and viral innate immune evasion based on shielding viral RNA species away from cellular innate immune sensors will be discussed from different angles. Subsequently, viral enzymatic activities that suppress innate immune responses will be discussed, including activities causing host shut-off and manipulation of stress granule formation. Furthermore, viral protease-mediated immune evasion and viral manipulation of the ubiquitin system will be addressed. Finally, perspectives for use of the reviewed knowledge for the development of novel antiviral strategies will be sketched.","['1 Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Molecular Virology Laboratory, Leiden, The Netherlands, m.kikkert@lumc.nl.']","Marjolein Kikkert, ",Journal of innate immunity,NO_DATE,2’O-methylation; Coronavirus; Endoribonuclease; Guanylate-binding proteins; HRV; IAV; Interferon; Replication organelles; Respiratory syncytial virus; Vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31610541

However, the lack of specific drugs to prevent/treat an attack is a major need at this current point of time. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to identify major druggable targets in coronavirus (CoV). We searched PubMed and RCSB database with keywords HCoV, NCoV, corona virus, SERS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV, crystal structure, X-ray crystallography structure, NMR structure, target, and drug target till Feb 3, 2020. The search identified seven major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, protease, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin esterase, and helicase) for which drug design can be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which can also be considered from the drug design perspective. The major structural proteins and NSPs may serve an important role from drug design perspectives. However, the occurrence of frequent recombination events is a major deterrent factor toward the development of CoV-specific vaccines/drugs.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', '2 Department of Biophysics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', '3 Department of Parasitology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', '4 Departments of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India.']","Manisha Prajapat, Phulen Sarma, Nishant Shekhar, Pramod Avti, Shweta Sinha, Hardeep Kaur, Subodh Kumar, Anusuya Bhattacharyya, Harish Kumar, Seema Bansal, Bikash Medhi, ",Indian journal of pharmacology,NO_DATE,Coronavirus; Middle East respiratory syndrome; drug targets; severe acute respiratory syndrome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32201449

30,The LUCA and its complex virome,"The last universal cellular ancestor (LUCA) is the most recent population of organisms from which all cellular life on Earth descends. The reconstruction of the genome and phenotype of the LUCA is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Given that all life forms are associated with viruses and/or other mobile genetic elements, there is no doubt that the LUCA was a host to viruses. Here, by projecting back in time using the extant distribution of viruses across the two primary domains of life, bacteria and archaea, and tracing the evolutionary histories of some key virus genes, we attempt a reconstruction of the LUCA virome. Even a conservative version of this reconstruction suggests a remarkably complex virome that already included the main groups of extant viruses of bacteria and archaea. We further present evidence of extensive virus evolution antedating the LUCA. The presence of a highly complex virome implies the substantial genomic and pan-genomic complexity of the LUCA itself.","['1 Archaeal Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. mart.krupovic@pasteur.fr.', '2 Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.', '3 National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA. koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.']","Mart Krupovic, Valerian V Dolja, Eugene V Koonin, ",Nature reviews.

31,Role of Viruses in the Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune inflammatory disease, where the underlying etiological cause remains elusive. Multiple triggering factors have been suggested, including environmental, genetic and gender components. However, underlying infectious triggers to the disease are also suspected. There is an increasing abundance of evidence supporting a viral etiology to MS, including the efficacy of interferon therapy and over-detection of viral antibodies and nucleic acids when compared with healthy patients. Several viruses have been proposed as potential triggering agents, including Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, John Cunningham virus and human endogenous retroviruses. These viruses are all near ubiquitous and have a high prevalence in adult populations (or in the case of the retroviruses are actually part of the genome). They can establish lifelong infections with periods of reactivation, which may be linked to the relapsing nature of MS. In this review, the evidence for a role for viral infection in MS will be discussed with an emphasis on immune system activation related to MS disease pathogenesis.","['1 School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Loughborough LE12 5RD, UK.', '2 Insititute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology Kazan Federal University, 420008 Kazan, Russia.', '3 School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA.']","Rachael E Tarlinton, Ekaterina Martynova, Albert A Rizvanov, Svetlana Khaiboullina, Subhash Verma, ",Viruses,2020,Epstein–Barr virus; John Cunningham virus; cytomegalovirus; human endogenous retroviruses; human herpesvirus 6; multiple sclerosis; varicella–zoster virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32545816
32,A pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of human coronavirus spike,"Continuously emerging highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) remain a major threat to human health, as illustrated in past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. The development of a drug with broad-spectrum HCoV inhibitory activity would address this urgent unmet medical need. Although previous studies have suggested that the HR1 of HCoV spike (S) protein is an important target site for inhibition against specific HCoVs, whether this conserved region could serve as a target for the development of broad-spectrum pan-CoV inhibitor remains controversial. Here, we found that peptide OC43-HR2P, derived from the HR2 domain of HCoV-OC43, exhibited broad fusion inhibitory activity against multiple HCoVs. EK1, the optimized form of OC43-HR2P, showed substantially improved pan-CoV fusion inhibitory activity and pharmaceutical properties. Crystal structures indicated that EK1 can form a stable six-helix bundle structure with both short α-HCoV and long β-HCoV HR1s, further supporting the role of HR1 region as a viable pan-CoV target site.","['1 Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology of MOE/MOH, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', '2 Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China.', '3 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.', '4 Department of Medical Laboratories Technology, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.', '5 Lindsley F.

34,Role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and its mitigation strategies for the development of vaccines and immunotherapies to counter COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global threat and death tolls are increasing worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 though shares similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, immunopathology of the novel virus is not understood properly. Previous reports from SARS and MERS-CoV documents that preexisting, non-neutralizing or poorly neutralizing antibodies developed as a result of vaccine or infection enhance subsequent infection, a phenomenon called as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Since immunotherapy has been implicated for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine is under development, due consideration has to be provided on ADE to prevent untoward reactions. ADE mitigation strategies like the development of vaccine or immunotherapeutics targeting receptor binding motif can be designed to minimize ADE of SARS-CoV-2 since full-length protein-based approach can lead to ADE as reported in MERS-CoV. The present mini-review aims to address the phenomenon of ADE of SARS-CoV-2 through the lessons learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and ways to mitigate them so as to develop better vaccines and immunotherapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Central University Laboratory, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University , Chennai, India.', '2 Poultry Disease Diagnosis and Surveillance Laboratory, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University , Chennai, India.', '3 Centre for Animal Health Studies, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University , Chennai, India.']","Kumaragurubaran Karthik, Tuticorin Maragatham Alagesan Senthilkumar, Shanmugasundaram Udhayavel, Gopal Dhinakar Raj, ",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2020,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antibody-dependent enhancement; immunotherapy; mAbs; spike protein; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845733
35,Speciation and the developmental alarm clock,"New species arise as the genomes of populations diverge. The developmental 'alarm clock' of speciation sounds off when sufficient divergence in genetic control of development leads hybrid individuals to infertility or inviability, the world awoken to the dawn of new species with intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Some developmental stages will be more prone to hybrid dysfunction due to how molecular evolution interacts with the ontogenetic timing of gene expression. Considering the ontogeny of hybrid incompatibilities provides a profitable connection between 'evo-devo' and speciation genetics to better link macroevolutionary pattern, microevolutionary process, and molecular mechanisms. Here, we explore speciation alongside development, emphasizing their mutual dependence on genetic network features, fitness landscapes, and developmental system drift. We assess models for how ontogenetic timing of reproductive isolation can be predictable. Experiments and theory within this synthetic perspective can help identify new rules of speciation as well as rules in the molecular evolution of development.","['1 Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '2 Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, United States.']","Asher D Cutter, Joanna D Bundus, ",eLife,2020,developmental biology; evo-devo; genetic networks; genetics; genomics; molecular evolution; reproductive isolation; speciation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32902377
36,Induction of Adipose Tissue Browning as a Strategy to Combat Obesity,"The ongoing obesity pandemic generates a constant need to develop new therapeutic strategies to restore the energy balance. Therefore, the concept of activating brown adipose tissue (BAT) in order to increase energy expenditure has been revived. In mammals, two developmentally distinct types of brown adipocytes exist; the classical or constitutive BAT that arises during embryogenesis, and the beige adipose tissue that is recruited postnatally within white adipose tissue (WAT) in the process called browning. Research of recent years has significantly increased our understanding of the mechanisms involved in BAT activation and WAT browning. They also allowed for the identification of critical molecules and critical steps of both processes and, therefore, many new therapeutic targets. Several non-pharmacological approaches, as well as chemical compounds aiming at the induction of WAT browning and BAT activation, have been tested in vitro as well as in animal models of genetically determined and/or diet-induced obesity. The therapeutic potential of some of these strategies has also been tested in humans. In this review, we summarize present concepts regarding potential therapeutic targets in the process of BAT activation and WAT browning and available strategies aiming at them.","['1 Department of Human Epigenetics, Mossakowski Medical Research Centre PAS, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.', '2 Department of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education, 01-826 Warsaw, Poland.']","Alina Kuryłowicz, Monika Puzianowska-Kuźnicka, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,beige adipocyte; brown adipocyte; obesity; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue browning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32872317
37,Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","['1 Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.', '2 School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']","Zi-Wei Ye, Shuofeng Yuan, Kit-San Yuen, Sin-Yee Fung, Chi-Ping Chan, Dong-Yan Jin, ",International journal of biological sciences,2020,COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; animal reservoir; bats; coronavirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32226286

However, most studies of vector transmission of plant viruses have focused on RNA viruses. All known plant ssDNA viruses belong to two economically important families, Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae, and in recent years, there have been increased efforts to understand whether they have evolved similar relationships with their respective insect vectors. This review describes the current understanding of ssDNA virus-vector interactions, including how these viruses cross insect vector cellular barriers, the responses of vectors to virus circulation, the possible existence of viral replication within insect vectors, and the three-way virus-vector-plant interactions. Despite recent breakthroughs in our understanding of these viruses, many aspects of plant ssDNA virus transmission remain elusive.

39,Brown Adipose Crosstalk in Tissue Plasticity and Human Metabolism,"Infants rely on brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a primary source of thermogenesis. In some adult humans, residuals of brown adipose tissue are adjacent to the central nervous system and acute activation increases metabolic rate. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) recruitment occurs during cold acclimation and includes secretion of factors, known as batokines, which target several different cell types within BAT, and promote adipogenesis, angiogenesis, immune cell interactions, and neurite outgrowth. All these processes seem to act in concert to promote an adapted BAT. Recent studies have also provided exciting data on whole body metabolic regulation with a broad spectrum of mechanisms involving BAT crosstalk with liver, skeletal muscle, and gut as well as the central nervous system. These widespread interactions might reflect the property of BAT of switching between an active thermogenic state where energy is highly consumed and drained from the circulation, and the passive thermoneutral state, where energy consumption is turned off.

Researchers are therefore focusing on steps in the CoV replication cycle that may be vulnerable to inhibition by broad-spectrum or specific antiviral agents. The conserved nature of the fusion domain and mechanism across the CoV family make it a valuable target to elucidate and develop pan-CoV therapeutics. In this article, we review the role of the CoV spike protein in mediating fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, summarizing the results of research on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and recent peer-reviewed studies of SARS-CoV-2, and suggest that the fusion mechanism be investigated as a potential antiviral target.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to the novel coronavirus (nCoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has caused a global public health emergency. To date, the molecular mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, its clinical manifestations and pathogenesis is not completely understood. The global scientific community has intensified its efforts in understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 for development of vaccines and therapeutic interventions to prevent the rapid spread of the virus and to control mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19. To understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, appropriate animal models that mimic the biology of human SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. In this review, we outline animal models that have been used to study previous human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Importantly, we discuss models that are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various available methods.","['1 Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', '2 Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', '3 Texas Biomedical Research Institute, Southwest National Primate Research Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', '4 Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Centre, Omaha, NE, USA.', '5 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Centre, Omaha, NE, USA.']","Kabita Pandey, Arpan Acharya, Mahesh Mohan, Caroline L Ng, St Patrick Reid, Siddappa N Byrareddy, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,NO_DATE,SARS-CoV-2; animal model; ferret; hamster; macaque; mice; pathophysiology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33128861
43,Brown and Beige Adipose Tissue and Aging,"Across aging, adipose tissue (AT) changes its quantity and distribution: AT becomes dysfunctional with an increase in production of inflammatory peptides, a decline of those with anti-inflammatory activity and infiltration of macrophages. Adipose organ dysfunction may lead to age-related metabolic alterations. Aging is characterized by an increase in adiposity and a decline in brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots and activity, and UCP1 expression. There are many possible links to age-associated involution of BAT, including the loss of mitochondrial function, impairment of the sympathetic nervous system, age-induced alteration of brown adipogenic stem/progenitor cell function and changes in endocrine signals. Aging is also associated with a reduction in beige adipocyte formation. Beige adipocytes are known to differentiate from a sub-population of progenitors resident in white adipose tissue (WAT); a defective ability of progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate has been hypothesized with aging. The loss of beige adipocytes with age may be caused by changes in trophic factors in the adipose tissue microenvironment, which regulate progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on possible mechanisms involved in the reduction of BAT and beige activity with aging, along with possible targets for age-related metabolic disease therapy.","['1 Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', '2 Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Surgery, Dentistry, Pediatric and Gynecology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']","Elena Zoico, Sofia Rubele, Annamaria De Caro, Nicole Nori, Gloria Mazzali, Francesco Fantin, Andrea Rossi, Mauro Zamboni, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2019,aging; beige adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue (BAT); inflammaging; metabolic disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31281288
44,Mining the Virome for Insights into Type 1 Diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Although environmental factors interplay with genetic susceptibility to promote immune dysregulation and disease, it remains unclear as to which potential environmental factors are causative and not simply correlative. Despite many hints that the microbiome can have a profound effect on T1D, significant changes in bacterial gut flora and diversity appear to emerge only after the detection of early signs of T1D. Surprisingly, we recently found significant differences in the gut virome preceding the initial signs of T1D, raising the tantalizing possibility that the state of the virome may influence or predict whether susceptible individuals progress on the path to disease. The challenge will be to discern whether there is likely a causative relationship between detected virome differences and T1D.","['1 Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis, Missouri.']","Arnold Park, Guoyan Zhao, ",DNA and cell biology,NO_DATE,CRESS DNA virus; bacteriophages; microbiome; type 1 diabetes; virome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29638163

49,Extracellular Vesicles in the Pathogenesis of Viral Infections in Humans,"Most cells can release extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane vesicles containing various proteins, nucleic acids, enzymes, and signaling molecules. The exchange of EVs between cells facilitates intercellular communication, amplification of cellular responses, immune response modulation, and perhaps alterations in viral pathogenicity. EVs serve a dual role in inhibiting or enhancing viral infection and pathogenesis.

50,Neurological complications of coronavirus infection; a comparative review and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Introduction:
        
      
      Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow all over the world. Several studies have been performed, focusing on understanding the acute respiratory syndrome and treatment strategies. However, there is growing evidence indicating neurological manifestations occur in patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the other coronaviruses (CoV) epidemics; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) have been associated with neurological complications. Methods:
        
      
      This systematic review serves to summarize available information regarding the potential effects of different types of CoV on the nervous system and describes the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19. Results:
        
      
      Two hundred and twenty-five studies on CoV infections associated neurological manifestations in human were reviewed. Of those, 208 articles were pertinent to COVID-19. The most common neurological complaints in COVID-19 were anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but more serious complications, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizures, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusion:
        
      
      There are several similarities between neurological complications after SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, however, the scope of the epidemics and number of patients are very different. Reports on the neurological complications after and during COVID-19 are growing on a daily basis. Accordingly, comprehensive knowledge of these complications will help health care providers to be attentive to these complications and diagnose and treat them timely.","['1 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Clinical Neurology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', '2 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', '3 Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', '4 Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, USA.

51,Spatial patterns of bat diversity overlap with woodpecker abundance,"Woodpecker diversity is usually higher in natural forests rich in dead wood and old trees than in managed ones, thus this group of birds is regarded as an indicator of forest biodiversity. Woodpeckers excavate cavities which can be subsequently used by several bird species. As a consequence, their abundance indicates high avian abundance and diversity in forests. However, woodpecker-made holes may be also important for other animals, for example, mammals but it has seldom been investigated so far. Here, we examine how well one species, the Great Spotted Woodpecker, predicts species richness, occurrence and acoustic activity of bats in Polish pine forests. In 2011 we conducted woodpecker and bat surveys at 63 point-count sites in forests that varied in terms of stand age, structure and amount of dead wood. From zero to five Great Spotted Woodpeckers at a point-count site were recorded. The total duration of the echolocation calls during a 10-min visit varied from 0 to 542 s and the number of bat species/species groups recorded during a visit ranged between zero to five. The local abundance of the woodpecker was positively correlated with bat species richness (on the verge of significance), bat occurrence and pooled bat activity. The occurrence of Eptesicus and Vespertilio bats and Nyctalus species was positively related with the abundance of the Great Spotted Woodpecker. The activity of Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio bats and a group of Myotis species was not associated with the woodpecker abundance, but echolocation calls of Nyctalus species, P. nathusii and P.pipistrellus were more often at sites with many Great Spotted Woodpeckers. Moreover, the probability of bat presence and the activity of bats was generally higher shortly after dusk and in middle of the summer than in late spring. We suggest that the observed correlations can be driven by similar roosting habitats (e.g., woodpeckers can provide breeding cavities for bats) or possibly by associated invertebrate food resources of woodpeckers and bats. The abundance of Great Spotted Woodpecker seems to be a good positive indicator of bat species richness, occurrence and activity, thus adding a group of relatively cryptic forest species that are indicated by the presence of the Great Spotted Woodpecker.","['1 Institute of Nature Conservation, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków, Poland.', '2 Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Białowieża, Poland.', '3 Department of Management and Logistics, Helena Chodkowska University of Technology and Economics, Warsaw, Poland.', '4 Nature and Forest Research Office, Warsaw, Poland.', '5 Department of Ecology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.']","Dorota Kotowska, Marcin Zegarek, Grzegorz Osojca, Andrzej Satory, Tomas Pärt, Michał Żmihorski, ",PeerJ,2020,Bat communities; Dendrocopos major; Indicator species; Managed forest; Windthrow.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32596056
52,"Genetic variants of the human host influencing the coronavirus-associated phenotypes (SARS, MERS and COVID-19): rapid systematic review and field synopsis","The COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the interest in the biological mechanisms underlying the complex interplay between infectious agents and the human host. The spectrum of phenotypes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from the absence of symptoms to severe systemic complications, raised the question as to what extent the variable response to coronaviruses (CoVs) is influenced by the variability of the hosts' genetic background.To explore the current knowledge about this question, we designed a systematic review encompassing the scientific literature published from Jan. 2003 to June 2020, to include studies on the contemporary outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (namely SARS, MERS and COVID-19 diseases). Studies were eligible if human genetic variants were tested as predictors of clinical phenotypes.An ad hoc protocol for the rapid review process was designed according to the PRISMA paradigm and registered at the PROSPERO database (ID: CRD42020180860). The systematic workflow provided 32 articles eligible for data abstraction (28 on SARS, 1 on MERS, 3 on COVID-19) reporting data on 26 discovery cohorts. Most studies considered the definite clinical diagnosis as the primary outcome, variably coupled with other outcomes (severity was the most frequently analysed). Ten studies analysed HLA haplotypes (1 in patients with COVID-19) and did not provide consistent signals of association with disease-associated phenotypes. Out of 22 eligible articles that investigated candidate genes (2 as associated with COVID-19), the top-ranked genes in the number of studies were ACE2, CLEC4M (L-SIGN), MBL, MxA (n = 3), ACE, CD209, FCER2, OAS-1, TLR4, TNF-α (n = 2). Only variants in MBL and MxA were found as possibly implicated in CoV-associated phenotypes in at least two studies. The number of studies for each predictor was insufficient to conduct meta-analyses.Studies collecting large cohorts from different ancestries are needed to further elucidate the role of host genetic variants in determining the response to CoVs infection. Rigorous design and robust statistical methods are warranted.","['1 Department of Health Sciences, University of Genova, Genova, Italy. emilio.dimaria@unige.it.', '2 Unit of Medical Genetics, Galliera Hospital, Genova, Italy. emilio.dimaria@unige.it.', '3 Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Genetics Unit, University of Roma ""Tor Vergata"", Roma, Italy.', '4 IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli (IS), Italy.', '5 Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, 89557, USA.']","Emilio Di Maria, Andrea Latini, Paola Borgiani, Giuseppe Novelli, ",Human genomics,2020,COVID-19; Coronavirus; Genetic association; Genetic susceptibility; Genomic biomarker; Genotype; Human host; Polymorphism.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917282
53,Evolution of bone cortical compactness in slow arboreal mammals,"Convergent evolution is a major topic in evolutionary biology. Low bone cortical compactness (CC, a measure of porosity of cortical bone) in the extant genera of ""tree sloths,"" has been linked to their convergent slow arboreal ecology. This proposed relationship of low CC with a slow arboreal lifestyle suggests potential convergent evolution of this trait in other slow arboreal mammals. Femoral and humeral CC were analyzed in ""tree sloths,"" lorisids, koala, and extinct palaeopropithecids and Megaladapis, in comparison to closely related but ecologically distinct taxa, in a phylogenetic framework. Low CC in ""tree sloths"" is unparalleled by any analyzed clade and the high CC in extinct sloths suggests the recent convergence of low CC in ""tree sloths."" A tendency for low CC was found in Palaeopropithecus and Megaladapis. However, lorisids and the koala yielded unexpected CC patterns, preventing the recognition of a straightforward convergence of low CC in slow arboreal mammals. This study uncovers a complex relationship between CC and convergent evolution of slow arboreality, highlighting the multifactorial specificity of bone microstructure.","['1 Institut für Biologie, Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Museum für Naturkunde, Leibniz-Institut für Evolutions- und Biodiversitätsforschung, Berlin, Germany.']","Fabio Alfieri, John A Nyakatura, Eli Amson, ",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,NO_DATE,Bone cortical compactness; convergent evolution; femur; humerus; subfossil lemurs; tree sloths.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314086

      Viral load kinetics and duration of viral shedding are important determinants for disease transmission. We aimed to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA shedding, and viable virus shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in various body fluids, and to compare SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral dynamics. Methods:
        
      
      In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, and the grey literature, for research articles published between Jan 1, 2003, and June 6, 2020. We included case series (with five or more participants), cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that reported SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV infection, and reported viral load kinetics, duration of viral shedding, or viable virus. Two authors independently extracted data from published studies, or contacted authors to request data, and assessed study quality and risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools. We calculated the mean duration of viral shedding and 95% CIs for every study included and applied the random-effects model to estimate a pooled effect size. We used a weighted meta-regression with an unrestricted maximum likelihood model to assess the effect of potential moderators on the pooled effect size. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020181914. Findings:
        
      
      79 studies (5340 individuals) on SARS-CoV-2, eight studies (1858 individuals) on SARS-CoV, and 11 studies (799 individuals) on MERS-CoV were included. Mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 17·0 days (95% CI 15·5-18·6; 43 studies, 3229 individuals) in upper respiratory tract, 14·6 days (9·3-20·0; seven studies, 260 individuals) in lower respiratory tract, 17·2 days (14·4-20·1; 13 studies, 586 individuals) in stool, and 16·6 days (3·6-29·7; two studies, 108 individuals) in serum samples. Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope 0·304 [95% CI 0·115-0·493]; p=0·0016). No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, despite persistently high viral loads, which were inferred from cycle threshold values. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the first week of illness, whereas that of SARS-CoV peaked at days 10-14 and that of MERS-CoV peaked at days 7-10. Interpretation:
        
      
      Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. SARS-CoV-2 titres in the upper respiratory tract peak in the first week of illness. Early case finding and isolation, and public education on the spectrum of illness and period of infectiousness are key to the effective containment of SARS-CoV-2. Funding:

58,Origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses in China,"Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. Here we use a Bayesian statistical framework and a large sequence data set from bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) in China to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission and dispersal. We find that host-switching occurs more frequently and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha- than beta-CoVs, and is more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.","['1 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA.', '2 Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Wildlife Conservation Society, Health Program, Bronx, NY, USA.', '3 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens And Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '4 Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '5 School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', '6 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '7 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens And Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.', '8 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA. daszak@ecohealthalliance.org.']","Alice Latinne, Ben Hu, Kevin J Olival, Guangjian Zhu, Libiao Zhang, Hongying Li, Aleksei A Chmura, Hume E Field, Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio, Jonathan H Epstein, Bei Li, Wei Zhang, Lin-Fa Wang, Zheng-Li Shi, Peter Daszak, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843626

In this study, next-generation sequencing was performed to obtain entire genome sequences of picornavirus from a picornavirus-positive bat feces sample (16BF77) and to explore novel viruses in a pooled bat sample (16BP) from samples collected in South Korea, 2016. Fourteen mammalian viral sequences were identified from 16BF77 and 29 from 16BP, and verified by RT-PCR. The most abundant virus in 16BF77 was picornavirus. Highly variable picornavirus sequences encoding 3Dpol were classified into genera Kobuvirus, Shanbavirus, and an unassigned group within the family Picornaviridae. Amino acid differences between these partial 3Dpol sequences were ≥ 65.7%. Results showed that one bat was co-infected by picornaviruses of more than two genera. Retrovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus A sequences also were found in the BP sample. The retrovirus and coronavirus genomes were identified in nine and eight bats, respectively. Korean bat retroviruses and coronavirus demonstrated strong genetic relationships with a Chinese bat retrovirus (RfRV) and coronavirus (HKU5-1), respectively. A co-infection was identified in one bat with a retrovirus and a coronavirus.

60,Broad-spectrum coronavirus antiviral drug discovery,"The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.","['1 a Division of Molecular and Translational Sciences , United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , Fort Detrick , MD , USA.']","Allison L Totura, Sina Bavari, ",Expert opinion on drug discovery,NO_DATE,ARDS; Antiviral; MERS; MERS-CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome; SARS; SARS-CoV; acute respiratory distress syndrome; bat; broad-spectrum; camel; civet; coronavirus; emerging virus; highly pathogenic virus; human cases; in vitro model; interferon; lopinavir; pneumonia; primate model; respiratory; ribavirin; rodent model; severe acute respiratory syndrome; therapeutic; zoonosis; zoonotic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30849247
61,Evolution in the light of fitness landscape theory,"By formalizing the relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness, fitness landscapes harbor information on molecular and evolutionary constraints. The shape of the fitness landscape determines the potential for adaptation and speciation, as well as our ability to predict evolution. Consequently, fitness landscape theory has been invoked across the natural sciences and across multiple levels of biological organization. We review here the existing literature on fitness landscape theory by describing the main types of fitness landscape models, and highlight how these are increasingly integrated into an applicable statistical framework for the study of evolution. Specifically, we demonstrate how the interpretation of experimental studies with respect to fitness landscape models enables a direct link between evolution, molecular biology, and systems biology.","['1 Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal.', '2 Department of Biology and Center for Computational Genetics and Genomics, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122-1801, USA.', '3 Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, 2780-156 Oeiras, Portugal.

62,Concepts of the last eukaryotic common ancestor,"Insight into the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) is central to any phylogeny-based reconstruction of early eukaryotic evolution. Increasing amounts of data enable such reconstructions, without necessarily providing further insight into what LECA actually was. We consider four possible concepts of LECA: an abstract phylogenetic state, a single cell, a population, and a consortium of organisms. We argue that the view most realistically underlying work in the field is that of LECA as a population. Drawing on recent findings of genomically heterogeneous populations in eukaryotes ('pangenomes'), we examine the evolutionary implications of a pangenomic LECA population. For instance, how does this concept affect standard expectations about the ecology, geography, fitness, and diversification of LECA? Does it affect evolutionary interpretations of LECA's cellular functions? Finally, we examine whether this novel pangenomic concept of LECA has implications for phylogenetic reconstructions of early eukaryote evolution. Our aim is to add to the conceptual toolkit for developing theories of LECA and interpreting genomic datasets.","['1 LaBRI, University of Bordeaux, Talence, France. maureen.omalley@sydney.edu.au.', '2 HPS, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. maureen.omalley@sydney.edu.au.', '3 Institute of Evolutionary Biology, UPF-CSIC Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', '4 Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '5 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', '6 Institute of Evolutionary Biology, UPF-CSIC Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. inaki.ruiz@ibe.upf-csic.es.', '7 Departament de Genètica, Microbiologia i Estadística, Facultat de Biologia, Institut de Recerca de la Biodiversitat (IRBio), Universitat de Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Spain. inaki.ruiz@ibe.upf-csic.es.', '8 ICREA, Barcelona, Spain. inaki.ruiz@ibe.upf-csic.es.']","Maureen A O'Malley, Michelle M Leger, Jeremy G Wideman, Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo, ",Nature ecology & evolution,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30778187
63,The discovery and global distribution of novel mosquito-associated viruses in the last decade (2007-2017),"In the last decade, virus hunting and discovery has gained pace. This achievement has been driven by three major factors: (a) advancements in sequencing technologies, (b) scaled-up routine arbovirus surveillance strategies, and (c) the ""hunt"" for emerging pathogens and novel viruses. Many novel viruses have been discovered from a myriad of hosts, vectors, and environmental samples. To help promote understanding of the global diversity and distribution of mosquito-associated viruses and facilitate future studies, we review mosquito-associated viruses discovered between years 2007 and 2017, across the world. In the analyzed period, novel mosquito-associated viruses belonging to 25 families and a general group of unclassified viruses were categorized. The top three discovered novel mosquito-associated viruses belonged to families Flaviviridae (n=32), Rhabdoviridae (n=16), and Peribunyaviridae (n=14). Also, 67 unclassified viruses were reported. Majority of these novel viruses were identified from Culex spp, Anopheles spp, Aedes spp, and Mansonia spp mosquitoes, respectively. Notably, the number of these discovered novels is not representative of intercontinental virus diversity but rather is influenced by the number of studies done in the study period. Some of these newly discovered mosquito-associated viruses have medical significance, either directly or indirectly. For instance, in the study period, 14 novel mosquito-borne viruses that infect mammalian cells in vitro were reported. These viruses pose a danger to the global health security on emerging viral diseases. On the other hand, some of the newly discovered insect specific viruses described herein have potential application as future biocontrol and vaccine agents against known pathogenic arboviruses. Overall, this review outlines the crucial role played by mosquitoes as viral vectors in the global virosphere.","['1 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '3 Veterinary Services Department, Kenya Wildlife Service, Nairobi, Kenya.', '4 Mammalogy Section, National Museum of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.']","Evans Atoni, Lu Zhao, Samuel Karungu, Vincent Obanda, Bernard Agwanda, Han Xia, Zhiming Yuan, ",Reviews in medical virology,NO_DATE,mosquito-associated viruses; novel viruses; virus discovery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31410931

65,Brown Adipose Tissue in Breast Cancer Evaluated by [ 18 F] FDG-PET/CT,"Purpose:
        
      
      Recently brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation has been proposed to have a possible role in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate BAT activation in patients with breast cancer and its relationship with molecular characteristics of tumor. Procedures:
        
      
      The study group comprised 79 patients with histologically proven ductal breast carcinoma (51 ± 13 years). Data on distribution, intensity (SUVmax), and total metabolic activity (TMA) of BAT were obtained from [18F] FDG-PET/CT. Clinical and biochemical data were obtained from the database. Results:
        
      
      BAT activation was present in 12 of the 79 patients (15.2 %). Patients with BAT activation were younger and had a lower body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0005, respectively) and showed less frequently metastasis (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67, grade, and in molecular subtypes. In patients younger than 55 years and with a BMI < 26, no significant differences were observed between patients with and without BAT activation. In the 12 patients with BAT activation, a significant inverse correlation was observed between TMA and BMI (r = - 0.64, p < 0.05). TMA and SUVmax were higher in grade 2 than in grade 3 patients. No significant differences were found in both TMA and SUVmax between patients with and without lymph node metastases. A significant difference in both TMA and SUVmax was observed among different molecular types, with luminal B patients showing higher values. Conclusions:
        
      
      In conclusion, the present study suggests a relation between BAT activation and positive known prognostic factor in breast cancer, such as intermediate tumor grade and luminal B cancer type.","['1 Dipartimento di Medicina, Chirurgia e Odontoiatria ""Scuola Medica Salernitana"", Università degli Studi di Salerno, Fisciano, Italy. lpace@unisa.it.', '2 IRCCS SDN, Naples, Italy.', '3 Department of Motor Sciences and Healthiness, University of Naples Parthenope, 80133, Naples, Italy.']","Leonardo Pace, Emanuele Nicolai, Luca Basso, Nunzia Garbino, Andrea Soricelli, Marco Salvatore, ",Molecular imaging and biology,NO_DATE,Breast cancer; Brown adipose tissue; PET/CT; [18F] FDG.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32034622
66,Role of Host-Mediated Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) in RNA Virus Pathogenesis,"Being opportunistic intracellular pathogens, viruses are dependent on the host for their replication. They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified. This review discusses various host and virus-mediated PTMs that play a role in the outcome during the infection.","['1 Vector Borne Disease Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi 110067, India.', '2 Department of Biosciences and Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Indore 453552, India.']","Ramesh Kumar, Divya Mehta, Nimisha Mishra, Debasis Nayak, Sujatha Sunil, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,RNA viruses; acetylation; glycosylation; host factors; pathogenesis; phosphorylation; post-translation modification; ubiquitination; virulence factors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33396899

68,Advancing behavioural genomics by considering timescale,"Animal behavioural traits often covary with gene expression, pointing towards a genomic constraint on organismal responses to environmental cues. This pattern highlights a gap in our understanding of the time course of environmentally responsive gene expression, and moreover, how these dynamics are regulated. Advances in behavioural genomics explore how gene expression dynamics are correlated with behavioural traits that range from stable to highly labile. We consider the idea that certain genomic regulatory mechanisms may predict the timescale of an environmental effect on behaviour. This temporally minded approach could inform both organismal and evolutionary questions ranging from the remediation of early life social trauma to understanding the evolution of trait plasticity.","['1 Department of Entomology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40546, USA. clare.rittschof@uky.edu.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, 32306, USA.']","Clare C Rittschof, Kimberly A Hughes, ",Nature communications,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29434301

70,Double-Membrane Vesicles as Platforms for Viral Replication,"Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, exploit cellular pathways and resources in a variety of fascinating ways. A striking example of this is the remodelling of intracellular membranes into specialized structures that support the replication of positive-sense ssRNA (+RNA) viruses infecting eukaryotes. These distinct forms of virus-induced structures include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), found during viral infections as diverse and notorious as those of coronaviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses, or hepatitis C virus. Our understanding of these DMVs has evolved over the past 15 years thanks to advances in imaging techniques and modern molecular biology tools. In this article, we review contemporary understanding of the biogenesis, structure, and function of virus-induced DMVs as well as the open questions posed by these intriguing structures.","['1 Section Electron Microscopy, Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '2 Molecular Virology laboratory, Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '3 Section Electron Microscopy, Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

71,Mosquito-Associated Viruses in China,"Mosquitoes are classified into approximately 3500 species and further grouped into 41 genera. Epidemiologically, they are considered to be among the most important disease vectors in the world and they can harbor a wide variety of viruses. Several mosquito viruses are considered to be of significant medical importance and can cause serious public health issues throughout the world. Such viruses are Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Others are the newly recognized mosquito viruses such as Banna virus (BAV) and Yunnan orbivirus (YNOV) with unclear medical significance. The remaining mosquito viruses are those that naturally infect mosquitoes but do not appear to infect humans or other vertebrates. With the continuous development and improvement of mosquito and mosquito-associated virus surveillance systems in China, many novel mosquito-associated viruses have been discovered in recent years. This review aims to systematically outline the history, characteristics, distribution, and/or current epidemic status of mosquito-associated viruses in China.","['1 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China. yzm@wh.iov.cn.']","Han Xia, Yujuan Wang, Evans Atoni, Bo Zhang, Zhiming Yuan, ",Virologica Sinica,NO_DATE,China; Mosquito associated viruses; Public health; Vector.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29532388
72,Lessons for COVID-19 Immunity from Other Coronavirus Infections,"A key goal to controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is developing an effective vaccine. Development of a vaccine requires knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response and also features that might be pathogenic. Protective and pathogenic aspects of the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not well understood, partly because the virus has infected humans for only 6 months. However, insight into coronavirus immunity can be informed by previous studies of immune responses to non-human coronaviruses, common cold coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review the literature describing these responses and discuss their relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.","['1 Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', '2 Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.

73,"Brown Adipose Tissue, Diet-Induced Thermogenesis, and Thermogenic Food Ingredients: From Mice to Men","Since the recent rediscovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans, this thermogenic tissue has been attracting increasing interest. The inverse relationship between BAT activity and body fatness suggests that BAT, because of its energy dissipating activity, is protective against body fat accumulation. Cold exposure activates and recruits BAT, resulting in increased energy expenditure and decreased body fatness. The stimulatory effects of cold exposure are mediated through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Most TRP members also function as chemesthetic receptors for various food ingredients, and indeed, agonists of TRP vanilloid 1 such as capsaicin and its analog capsinoids mimic the effects of cold exposure to decrease body fatness through the activation and recruitment of BAT. The antiobesity effect of other food ingredients including tea catechins may be attributable, at least in part, to the activation of the TRP-SNS-BAT axis. BAT is also involved in the facultative thermogenesis induced by meal intake, referred to as diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), which is a significant component of the total energy expenditure in our daily lives. Emerging evidence suggests a crucial role for the SNS in BAT-associated DIT, particularly during the early phase, but several gut-derived humoral factors may also participate in meal-induced BAT activation. One intriguing factor is bile acids, which activate BAT directly through Takeda G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) in brown adipocytes. Given the apparent beneficial effects of some TRP agonists and bile acids on whole-body substrate and energy metabolism, the TRP/TGR5-BAT axis represents a promising target for combating obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans.","['1 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', '2 Department of Nutrition, Tenshi College, Sapporo, Japan.', '3 Division of Metabolic Medicine, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']","Masayuki Saito, Mami Matsushita, Takeshi Yoneshiro, Yuko Okamatsu-Ogura, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,bile acids; brown adipose tissue; diet-induced thermogenesis; food ingredients; gut hormone; obesity; sympathetic nervous system; transient receptor potential channels.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32373072

75,Genomic Convergence in the Adaptation to Extreme Environments,"Convergent evolution is especially common in plants that have independently adapted to the same extreme environments (i.e., extremophile plants). The recent burst of omics data has alleviated many limitations that have hampered molecular convergence studies of non-model extremophile plants. In this review, we summarize cases of genomic convergence in these taxa to examine the extent and type of genomic convergence during the process of adaptation to extreme environments. Despite being well studied by candidate gene approaches, convergent evolution at individual sites is rare and often has a high false-positive rate when assessed in whole genomes. By contrast, genomic convergence at higher genetic levels has been detected during adaptation to the same extreme environments. Examples include the convergence of biological pathways and changes in gene expression, gene copy number, amino acid usage, and GC content. Higher convergence levels play important roles in the adaptive evolution of extremophiles and may be more frequent and involve more genes. In several cases, multiple types of convergence events have been found to co-occur. However, empirical and theoretical studies of this higher level convergent evolution are still limited. In conclusion, both the development of powerful approaches and the detection of convergence at various genetic levels are needed to further reveal the genetic mechanisms of plant adaptation to extreme environments.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, Key Laboratory of Biodiversity Dynamics and Conservation of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']","Shaohua Xu, Jiayan Wang, Zixiao Guo, Ziwen He, Suhua Shi, ",Plant communications,2020,adaptive evolution; convergent evolution; extreme environments; plant genomes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33367270
76,The new scope of virus taxonomy: partitioning the virosphere into 15 hierarchical ranks,"Virus taxonomy emerged as a discipline in the middle of the twentieth century. Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the ICTV has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Executive Committee, ",Nature microbiology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32341570
77,The Diverse Roles of microRNAs at the Host⁻Virus Interface,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Through this activity, they are implicated in almost every cellular process investigated to date. Hence, it is not surprising that miRNAs play diverse roles in regulation of viral infections and antiviral responses. Diverse families of DNA and RNA viruses have been shown to take advantage of cellular miRNAs or produce virally encoded miRNAs that alter host or viral gene expression. MiRNA-mediated changes in gene expression have been demonstrated to modulate viral replication, antiviral immune responses, viral latency, and pathogenesis. Interestingly, viruses mediate both canonical and non-canonical interactions with miRNAs to downregulate specific targets or to promote viral genome stability, translation, and/or RNA accumulation. In this review, we focus on recent findings elucidating several key mechanisms employed by diverse virus families, with a focus on miRNAs at the host⁻virus interface during herpesvirus, polyomavirus, retroviruses, pestivirus, and hepacivirus infections.","['1 Department of Microbiology & Immunology, McGill University, Montréal, QC H3G 1Y6, Canada.

78,Switching on the furnace: Regulation of heat production in brown adipose tissue,"Endothermy requires a source of endogenous heat production. In birds, this is derived primarily from shivering, but in mammals it is mostly non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized tissue found in Eutherian mammals that is the source of most NST. Heat production in BAT depends primarily on the activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which decouples transport of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane from synthesis of ATP. UCP1 and hence heat production of BAT is regulated by many factors. In this paper we discuss the main factors activating UCP1 and increasing heat production. Probably the most well-known activator is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE) which is released from sympathetic nerve endings and binds to adrenergic receptors that are abundantly expressed on BAT. NE stimulates release of free-fatty acids. It was previously thought that such FFAs were essential for activation of UCP1. However recent work has suggested intracellular lipolysis is not essential and FFAs can be derived from extracellular sources. Thyroid hormones also exert impacts on metabolic rate via effects on brown adipocytes which express type 2 deiodinase. Knocking out DIO2 makes mice cold intolerant. Parathyroid hormone appears to also be a potent regulator of BAT activity and may be an important mediator of elevated expenditure during cancer cachexia, although this is disputed by observations that cachexia wasting is not blunted in UCP1 KO mice. Cardiac natriuretic peptides have also been implicated in regulating BAT thermogenesis and the interconversion of beige adipocytes from their white to brown form. Activation of BAT thermogenesis may be an important component of the post-ingestion rise in heat production. Recent work suggests the gut derived hormone secretin may play a key role in this effect, directly linking BAT activation to the alimentary tract. Not only gut hormones but also metabolites derived from gut microbiota such as butyrate may be an important activator of BAT during cold exposure. Additional regulatory factors include bone morphogenic proteins, fibroblast growth factor 21, Vascular endothelial growth factors and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptors which are important components of thermal sensing and hence how brown adipose tissue responds to the cold. In the future the main challenge is to understand how these regulatory factors combine with each other and with inhibitory factors to control heat production from BAT, and what their relative importance is in differing circumstances. Knocking out UCP1 has revealed other sources of heat production in BAT including creatine-dependent cycles and a futile cycle of Ca2+ shuttling into and out of the endoplasmic reticulum via the SERCA and ryanodine receptors.","['1 Hypothalamic Research Center, Department of Internal Medicine, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', '2 Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, PR China; Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB24 2TZ, Scotland, UK.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, PR China; Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB24 2TZ, Scotland, UK; CAS Center for Excellence in Animal Evolution and Genetics (CCEAEG), Kunming, Yunnan, PR China.

79,The macroevolutionary landscape of short-necked plesiosaurians,"Throughout their evolution, tetrapods have repeatedly colonised a series of ecological niches in marine ecosystems, producing textbook examples of convergent evolution. However, this evolutionary phenomenon has typically been assessed qualitatively and in broad-brush frameworks that imply simplistic macroevolutionary landscapes. We establish a protocol to visualize the density of trait space occupancy and thoroughly test for the existence of macroevolutionary landscapes. We apply this protocol to a new phenotypic dataset describing the morphology of short-necked plesiosaurians, a major component of the Mesozoic marine food webs (ca. 201 to 66 Mya). Plesiosaurians evolved this body plan multiple times during their 135-million-year history, making them an ideal test case for the existence of macroevolutionary landscapes. We find ample evidence for a bimodal craniodental macroevolutionary landscape separating latirostrines from longirostrine taxa, providing the first phylogenetically-explicit quantitative assessment of trophic diversity in extinct marine reptiles. This bimodal pattern was established as early as the Middle Jurassic and was maintained in evolutionary patterns of short-necked plesiosaurians until a Late Cretaceous (Turonian) collapse to a unimodal landscape comprising longirostrine forms with novel morphologies. This study highlights the potential of severe environmental perturbations to profoundly alter the macroevolutionary dynamics of animals occupying the top of food chains.","['1 Evolution & Diversity Dynamics Lab, Université de Liège, 14 Allée du 6 Août, 4000, Liège, Belgium. v.fischer@uliege.be.', '2 Evolution & Diversity Dynamics Lab, Université de Liège, 14 Allée du 6 Août, 4000, Liège, Belgium.', '3 Department of Paleobiology, Smithsonian Institution, P.O.

80,Not all phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible,"Unrooted phylogenetic networks are graphs used to represent reticulate evolutionary relationships. Accurately reconstructing such networks is of great relevance for evolutionary biology. It has recently been conjectured that all unrooted phylogenetic networks for at least five taxa can be uniquely reconstructed from their subnetworks obtained by deleting a single taxon.

Moreover, we show that the conjecture is still false when restricted to binary networks.

81,"Diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019: back to the future","The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as named by the World Health Organization has millions of confirmed cases around the world and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia. In a small subset of severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death. Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of COVID-19. Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development. Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.","['1 Department of Microbiology and School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']","Zi-Wei Ye, Dong-Yan Jin, ",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,2020,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; antiviral therapy; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); coronavirus vaccines; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV); virological diagnosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32347053
82,Functional interrogation of a SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome identifies unique and shared coronavirus host factors,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed more than 1.7 million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen SARS-CoV-2 at two physiologically relevant temperatures along with three related coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E], HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution than genome-scale studies. This approach yielded several insights, including potential virus-specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.","['1 Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', '2 Cancer Biology and Genetics, MSKCC New York, NY 10065, USA.', '3 Laboratory of Chromatin Biology & Epigenetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', '4 Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016 USA.', '5 Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', '6 Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna BioCenter (VBC), Vienna, Austria; Medical University of Vienna, Vienna BioCenter (VBC), Vienna, Austria.', '7 Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016 USA.

83,Systems genetic analysis of brown adipose tissue function,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been suggested to play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism in rodents and possibly also in humans. In the current study, we used genetic and correlation analyses in the BXH/HXB recombinant inbred (RI) strains, derived from Brown Norway (BN) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), to identify genetic determinants of BAT function. Linkage analyses revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with interscapular BAT mass on chromosome 4 and two closely linked QTLs associated with glucose oxidation and glucose incorporation into BAT lipids on chromosome 2. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) we identified 1,147 gene coexpression modules in the BAT from BXH/HXB rats and mapped their module eigengene QTLs. Through an unsupervised analysis, we identified modules related to BAT relative mass and function. The Coral4.1 coexpression module is associated with BAT relative mass (includes Cd36 highly connected gene), and the Darkseagreen coexpression module is associated with glucose incorporation into BAT lipids (includes Hiat1, Fmo5, and Sort1 highly connected transcripts). Because multiple statistical criteria were used to identify candidate modules, significance thresholds for individual tests were not adjusted for multiple comparisons across modules. In summary, a systems genetic analysis using genomic and quantitative transcriptomic and physiological information has produced confirmation of several known genetic factors and significant insight into novel genetic components functioning in BAT and possibly contributing to traits characteristic of the metabolic syndrome.","['1 Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences , Prague , Czech Republic.', '2 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus , Aurora, Colorado.', '3 Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences , Prague , Czech Republic.', '4 Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.', '5 Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus , Aurora, Colorado.']","Michal Pravenec, Laura M Saba, Václav Zídek, Vladimír Landa, Petr Mlejnek, Jan Šilhavý, Miroslava Šimáková, Hynek Strnad, Jaroslava Trnovská, Vojtěch Škop, Martina Hüttl, Irena Marková, Olena Oliyarnyk, Hana Malínská, Ludmila Kazdová, Harry Smith, Boris Tabakoff, ",Physiological genomics,2018,brown adipose tissue; coexpression modules; quantitative trait locus; recombinant inbred strains; spontaneously hypertensive rat.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29127223

      The role of respiratory co-infections in modulating disease severity remains understudied in southern Africa, particularly in rural areas. This study was performed to characterize the spectrum of respiratory pathogens in rural southern Zambia and the prognostic impact of co-infections. Methods:
        
      
      Respiratory specimens collected from inpatient and outpatient participants in a viral surveillance program in 2018-2019 were tested for selected viruses and atypical bacteria using the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay and FilmArray Respiratory Panel EZ. Participants were followed for 3-5 weeks to assess their clinical course. Multivariable regression was used to examine the role of co-infections in influencing disease severity. Results:
        
      
      A respiratory pathogen was detected in 63.2% of samples from 671 participants who presented with influenza-like illness. Common pathogens identified included influenza virus (18.2% of samples), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (11.8%), rhinovirus (26.4%), and coronavirus (6.0%). Overall, 6.4% of participants were co-infected with multiple respiratory pathogens. Compared to mono-infections, co-infections were found not to be associated with severe clinical illness either overall (relative risk (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.32) or specifically with influenza virus (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.14-4.46) or RSV infections (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17-1.11). Conclusions:
        
      
      Respiratory infections in rural southern Zambia were associated with a wide range of viruses. Respiratory co-infections in this population were not associated with clinical severity.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', '2 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', '3 Macha Research Trust, Macha, Zambia.', '4 Department of Emergency Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', '5 Virology Laboratory, University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia.', '6 Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', '7 Macha Research Trust, Macha, Zambia; Virology Laboratory, University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia.', '8 Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

As of 17 April 2020, it has infected 2 114 269 people, resulting in 145 144 deaths. The timing, magnitude and longevity of humoral immunity is not yet understood for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, understanding this is urgently required to inform the likely future dynamics of the pandemic, to guide strategies to allow relaxation of social distancing measures and to understand how to deploy limiting vaccine doses when they become available to achieve maximum impact. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human coronavirus to be described. Four human coronaviruses circulate seasonally and cause common colds. Two other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, have crossed from animal sources into humans but have not become endemic. Here we review what is known about the human humoral immune response to epidemic SARS CoV and MERS CoV and to the seasonal, endemic coronaviruses. Then we summarize recent, mostly non-peer reviewed, studies into SARS-CoV-2 serology and reinfection in humans and non-human primates and summarize current pressing research needs.","['1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Faulty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, W2 1NY, UK.', '2 Kymab Ltd, The Bennet Building (B930), Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, CB22 3AT, UK.']","Paul Kellam, Wendy Barclay, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antibodies; reinfection; serology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32430094

NGS data from nearly all tumor and normal tissues examined contained contaminating viral sequences. Intensive computational and manual efforts are required to remove these artifacts. We found that several different types of cancers harbored Herpesviruses including EBV, CMV, HHV1, HHV2, HHV6 and HHV7. In addition to the reported associations of Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV & HCV) with liver cancer, and Human papillomaviruses (HPV) with cervical cancer and a subset of head and neck cancers, we found additional cases of HPV integrated in a small number of bladder cancers. Gene expression and mutational profiles suggest that HPV drives tumorigenesis in these cases.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.

However, there is a lack of effective antiviral agents for many coronavirus strains. Naturally existing compounds provide a wealth of chemical diversity, including antiviral activity, and thus may have utility as therapeutic agents against coronaviral infections. The PubMed database was searched for papers including the keywords coronavirus, SARS or MERS, as well as traditional medicine, herbal, remedy or plants, with 55 primary research articles identified. The overwhelming majority of publications focussed on polar compounds. Compounds that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans include scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, saikosaponin B2, quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, and lectins such as griffithsin. Other compounds such as lycorine may be suitable if a therapeutic level of antiviral activity can be achieved without exceeding toxic plasma concentrations.

92,SARS-CoV-2-mediated immune system activation and potential application in immunotherapy,"Although novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated pulmonary inflammation has recently attracted great attention, its pathology and pathogenesis are not clear. Notably, due to both its high infective and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease. A specific vaccine, which relies on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein-derived antigenic peptides, is indispensable for restraining the spread and reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections activate cytototxic, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, as well as natural killer, B, helper T, and regulatory T cells, thus further stimulating innate and antigen-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, many immune effector cells cause hyperinflammation and pulmonary immunopathology by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP1B, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and induced protein 10. Interestingly, related products derived from SARS-CoV-2 are likely to trigger immune evasion. Therefore, investigating SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines, blocking immunopathology, and prohibiting immune evasion are urgently required for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we emphatically illuminated the development of a SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccine based on the analysis of epitopes, also expounding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome.

Given the quasispecies (mutant cloud) nature of RNA viruses and many DNA viruses, en bloc transmission of multiple genomes provides different starting points in sequence space to initiate adaptive walks, and has implications for modulation of viral fitness and for the response of viral populations to lethal mutagenesis. Mechanisms that can enable multiple viral genomes to be transported en bloc among hosts has only recently been gaining attention. A growing body of research suggests that extracellular vesicles (EV) are highly prevalent and robust vehicles for en bloc delivery of viral particles and naked infectious genomes among organisms.

The virus quickly spread around the world, causing a sustained global outbreak. Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses. This review comprehensively addresses in detail the variations in S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics and detailed structural interactions, the process of cleavage involved in priming, as well as other differences between coronaviruses.","['1 Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Health Sciences, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13133, Jordan.', '2 Cell Therapy Center (CTC), The University of Jordan, Amman 11942, Jordan.', '3 Department of Immunology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan 16150, Malaysia.', '4 Prince Hamza Hospital, Amman 11947, Jordan.', '5 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13133, Jordan.', '6 Drug Design and Discovery Unit, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Amman 11942, Jordan.', '7 Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC J1H 5N4, Canada.', '8 Translational Immunology and Nanotechnology Unit, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora 3083, Australia.', '9 Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Health Campus, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan 16150, Malaysia.']","Ma'mon M Hatmal, Walhan Alshaer, Mohammad A I Al-Hatamleh, Malik Hatmal, Othman Smadi, Mutasem O Taha, Ayman J Oweida, Jennifer C Boer, Rohimah Mohamud, Magdalena Plebanski, ",Cells,2020,COVID-19; coronaviruses; proline; receptor-binding motif; spike protein; terminal region.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33302501
96,Autophagy inhibition prevents glucocorticoid-increased adiposity via suppressing BAT whitening,"The mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid (GC)-increased adiposity are poorly understood. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) acquires white adipose tissue (WAT) cell features defined as BAT whitening under certain circumstances. The aim of our current study was to investigate the possibility and mechanisms of GC-induced BAT whitening. Here, we showed that one-week dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induced BAT whitening, characterized by lipid droplet accumulation, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, autophagy and ATG7 (autophagy related 7) expression was induced in BAT by Dex, and treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine or adenovirus-mediated ATG7 knockdown prevented Dex-induced BAT whitening and fat mass gain. Moreover, Dex-increased ATG7 expression and autophagy was mediated by enhanced expression of BTG1 (B cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative) that stimulated activity of CREB1 (cAMP response element binding protein 1). The importance of BTG1 in this regulation was further demonstrated by the observed BAT whitening in adipocyte-specific BTG1-overexpressing mice and the attenuated Dex-induced BAT whitening and fat mass gain in mice with BTG1 knockdown in BAT. Taken together, we showed that Dex induces a significant whitening of BAT via BTG1- and ATG7-dependent autophagy, which might contribute to Dex-increased adiposity. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying GC-increased adiposity and possible strategy for preventing GC-induced side effects via the combined use of an autophagy inhibitor.Abbreviations: ACADL: acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long-chain; ACADM: acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium-chain; ACADS: acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, short-chain; ADIPOQ: adiponectin; AGT: angiotensinogen; Atg: autophagy-related; BAT: brown adipose tissue; BTG1: B cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative; CEBPA: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha; CIDEA: cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, alpha subunit-like effector A; CPT1B: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b, muscle; CPT2: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2; CQ: chloroquine; Dex: dexamethasone; eWAT: epididymal white adipose tissue; FABP4: fatty acid binding protein 4, adipocyte; FFAs: free fatty acids; GCs: glucocorticoids; NRIP1: nuclear receptor interacting protein 1; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PPARA: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; PPARG: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; PPARGC1A: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha; PRDM16: PR domain containing 16; PSAT1: phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; RB1: RB transcriptional corepressor 1; RBL1/p107: RB transcriptional corepressor like 1; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; sWAT: subcutaneous white adipose tissue; TG: triglycerides; UCP1: uncoupling protein 1 (mitochondrial, proton carrier); WT: wild-type.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Nutrition, Metabolism and Food Safety, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', '3 The Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences & Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']","Jiali Deng, Yajie Guo, Feixiang Yuan, Shanghai Chen, Hanrui Yin, Xiaoxue Jiang, Fuxin Jiao, Fenfen Wang, Hongbin Ji, Guohong Hu, Hao Ying, Yan Chen, Qiwei Zhai, Fei Xiao, Feifan Guo, ",Autophagy,NO_DATE,ATG7; BAT whitening; BTG1; autophagy; glucocorticoid.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184563
97,Development of CRISPR as an Antiviral Strategy to Combat SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the need for antiviral approaches that can target emerging viruses with no effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals. Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.","['1 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', '3 Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', '4 DNARx, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.', '5 Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', '6 Los Altos High School, Los Altos, CA 94022, USA.', '7 Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

98,Berberine promotes the recruitment and activation of brown adipose tissue in mice and humans,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates metabolic energy and mediates non-shivering thermogenesis, thereby boosting energy expenditure. Increasing BAT mass and activity is expected to be a promising strategy for combating obesity; however, few medications effectively and safely recruit and activate BAT in humans. Berberine (BBR), a natural compound, is commonly used as a nonprescription drug to treat diarrhea. Here, we reported that 1-month BBR intervention increased BAT mass and activity, reduced body weight, and improved insulin sensitivity in mildly overweight patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Chronic BBR treatment promoted BAT development by stimulating the expression of brown adipogenic genes, enhanced BAT thermogenesis, and global energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice and chow-fed lean mice, Consistently, BBR facilitated brown adipocyte differentiation in both mouse and human primary brown preadipocytes. We further found that BBR increased the transcription of PRDM16, a master regulator of brown/beige adipogenesis, by inducing the active DNA demethylation of PRDM16 promoter, which might be driven by the activation of AMPK and production of its downstream tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-Ketoglutarate. Moreover, chronic BBR administration had no impact on the BAT thermogenesis in adipose-specific AMPKa1 and AMPKa2 knockout mice. In summary, we found that BBR intervention promoted recruitment and activation of BAT and AMPK-PRDM16 axis was indispensable for the pro-BAT and pro-energy expenditure properties of BBR. Our findings suggest that BBR may be a promising drug for obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans partially through activating BAT.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, P.

99,"Aifm2, a NADH Oxidase, Supports Robust Glycolysis and Is Required for Cold- and Diet-Induced Thermogenesis","Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is highly metabolically active tissue that dissipates energy via UCP1 as heat, and BAT mass is correlated negatively with obesity. The presence of BAT/BAT-like tissue in humans renders BAT as an attractive target against obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we identify Aifm2, a NADH oxidoreductase domain containing flavoprotein, as a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein highly enriched in BAT. Aifm2 is induced by cold as well as by diet. Upon cold or β-adrenergic stimulation, Aifm2 associates with the outer side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a unique BAT-specific first mammalian NDE (external NADH dehydrogenase)-like enzyme, Aifm2 oxidizes NADH to maintain high cytosolic NAD levels in supporting robust glycolysis and to transfer electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) for fueling thermogenesis. Aifm2 in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) promotes oxygen consumption, uncoupled respiration, and heat production during cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. Aifm2, thus, can ameliorate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.","['1 Endocrinology Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '2 Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '3 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.', '4 Endocrinology Program, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.

By contextualizing his framework within two decades of theorizing about major transitions in evolution, we identify some basic problems that Bonner's theory shares with much of the prevailing literature. These problems include implicit progressivism, theoretical disunity, and a limited ability to explain major evolutionary transformations. We go on to identify events and processes that are neglected by existing views.

However, BAT is also related to many kinds of diseases, such as obesity and metabolic disorders. The progression of such diseases occurs at the cellular level, and thus, imaging techniques could prove greatly beneficial for determining optimal therapeutic regimens. Currently, positron-emission tomography (PET) is considered to be the gold standard for assessing the function of activated BAT. However, PET also has inherent disadvantages, and, thus, recent efforts have been focused on exploring, and potentially developing, new imaging techniques to better observe BAT and evaluate its metabolic function. Researchers have already achieved promising success with computed tomography, magnetic resonance approaches, ultrasound, new tracers for use in PET, and other imaging techniques through in vivo and in vitro animal experiments. Since, these studies have shown that BAT may serve as an effective therapeutic target for treatment of metabolic dysfunction diseases, the development of an efficient in vivo BAT imaging technique that is applicable to humans will prove to be of great clinical value. In this review, classical PET imaging technique is highlighted as well as the current status of preclinical imaging methods developed for BAT examination.","['1 Department of Ultrasound, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shengjing Hospital, No. 36, Sanhao Street, Heping District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.', '2 Department of Ultrasound, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shengjing Hospital, No. 36, Sanhao Street, Heping District, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.

The R0 maximisation paradigm requires this feedback loop to be one-dimensional, which notably excludes pathogen diversification. By contrast, almost all realistic ecological ingredients of host-pathogen interactions (density-dependent mortality, multiple infections, limited cross-immunity, multiple transmission routes, host heterogeneity, and spatial structure) will lead to multidimensional feedbacks.","[""1 Centre d'Écologie Fonctionnelle et Évolutive, CNRS, Université de Montpellier, Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3, EPHE, IRD, 1919, route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.

111,Human brown adipose tissue: Classical brown rather than brite/beige?,"New findings:
        
      
      What is the topic of this review? It has been suggested that human brown adipose tissue (BAT) is more similar to the brite/beige adipose tissue of mice than to classical BAT of mice. The basis of this is discussed in relationship to the physiological conditions of standard experimental mice. What advances does it highlight? We highlight that, provided mouse adipose tissues are examined under physiological conditions closer to those prevalent for most humans, the gene expression profile of mouse classical BAT is more similar to that of human BAT than is the profile of mouse brite/beige adipose tissue. Human BAT is therefore not different in nature from classical mouse BAT. Abstract:
        
      
      Since the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was established in adult humans some 13 years ago, its physiological significance and molecular characteristics have been discussed. In particular, it has been proposed that the mouse adipose tissue depot most closely resembling and molecularly parallel to human BAT is not classical mouse BAT. Instead, so-called brite or beige adipose tissue, which is characteristically observed in the inguinal 'white' adipose tissue depot of mice, has been proposed to be the closest mouse equivalent of human BAT. We summarize here the published evidence examining this question. We emphasize the differences in tissue appearance and tissue transcriptomes from 'standard' mice [young, chow fed and, in effect semi-cold exposed (20°C)] versus 'physiologically humanized' mice [middle-aged, high-fat diet-fed mice living at thermoneutrality (30°C)]. We find that in the physiologically humanized mice, classical BAT displays molecular and cellular characteristics that are more akin to human BAT than are those of brite/beige adipose tissues from either standard or physiologically humanized mice. We suggest, therefore, that mouse BAT is the more relevant tissue for translational studies. This is an invited summary of a presentation given at Physiology 2019 (Aberdeen).","['1 Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.']","Barbara Cannon, Jasper M A de Jong, Alexander W Fischer, Jan Nedergaard, Natasa Petrovic, ",Experimental physiology,NO_DATE,beige fat; brown fat; thermoneutrality.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378255

The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.","[""1 School of Medicine, The Maldives National University, Male', Maldives.

Such a distortion may affect diversifying evolution as well as directional evolution. In adaptive dynamics theory, diversifying evolution through ecological interaction is called evolutionary branching. This study analytically develops conditions for evolutionary branching in distorted trait spaces of arbitrary dimensions, by a local nonlinear coordinate transformation so that the mutational covariance matrix becomes locally constant in the neighborhood of a focal point. The developed evolutionary branching conditions can be affected by the distortion when mutational step sizes have significant magnitude difference among directions, i.e., the eigenvalues of the mutational covariance matrix have significant magnitude difference.","['1 Department of Evolutionary Studies of Biosystems, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI, Hayama, Kanagawa 240-0193, Japan.

The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","['1 National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology; Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, PR China; Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, PR China.', '2 National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology; Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, PR China; Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, PR China; Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, PR China.

116,The 'biomineralization toolkit' and the origin of animal skeletons,"Biomineralized skeletons are widespread in animals, and their origins can be traced to the latest Ediacaran or early Cambrian fossil record, in virtually all animal groups. The origin of animal skeletons is inextricably linked with the diversification of animal body plans and the dramatic changes in ecology and geosphere-biosphere interactions across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. This apparent independent acquisition of skeletons across diverse animal clades has been proposed to have been driven by co-option of a conserved ancestral genetic toolkit in different lineages at the same time. This 'biomineralization toolkit' hypothesis makes predictions of the early evolution of the skeleton, predictions tested herein through a critical review of the evidence from both the fossil record and development of skeletons in extant organisms. Furthermore, the distribution of skeletons is here plotted against a time-calibrated animal phylogeny, and the nature of the deep ancestors of biomineralizing animals interpolated using ancestral state reconstruction. All these lines of evidence point towards multiple instances of the evolution of biomineralization through the co-option of an inherited organic skeleton and genetic toolkit followed by the stepwise acquisition of more complex skeletal tissues under tighter biological control. This not only supports the 'biomineralization toolkit' hypothesis but also provides a model for describing the evolution of complex biological systems across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition.","['1 Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PW, U.K.']","Duncan J E Murdock, ",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,NO_DATE,Cambrian; Ediacaran; biomineralization; metazoan toolkit; skeletons.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32447836
117,Brown and beige fat: From molecules to physiology,The recent re-discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and even more recent discovery of the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) in humans have generated intense scientific interest in the role of adipose tissue as potential target against obesity and its metabolic complications. The purpose of this review is to: i) critically evaluate the current evidence on the physiological significance of BAT and the browning of WAT in metabolic function in humans and ii) discuss factors that have been reported to regulate BAT and/or the browning of WAT in humans. The current literature supports that BAT and the browning of WAT constitute promising emerging targets for interventions aiming to prevent and/or treat of obesity and its metabolic complications. Further research is needed to better understand the physiological significance of BAT and browning of WAT in health and disease along with the factors modulating their metabolic function in humans.,"['1 Center for Human Nutrition, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, United States; Harokopio University of Athens, Greece.', '2 Harokopio University of Athens, Greece; Departments of Medicine and Exercise Science and Sports Studies, Rutgers University, United States; Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, United States.

We draw on insights from molecular and evolutionary biology perspectives to identify three general features of 'non-genetic' inheritance systems: (i) they are functionally interdependent with, rather than separate from, DNA sequence; (ii) precise mechanisms vary phylogenetically and operationally; and (iii) epigenetic elements are probabilistic, interactive regulatory factors and not deterministic 'epialleles' with defined genomic locations and effects. We discuss each of these features and offer recommendations for future empirical and theoretical research that implements a unifying inherited gene regulation (IGR) approach to studies of 'non-genetic' inheritance.","['1 Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health, Department for Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Länggassstrasse 122, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.

120,Bat lyssaviruses,"Bats (order Chiroptera) are the principal reservoir host for 14 of the 16 officially recognised lyssavirus species. Rabies virus is the only lyssavirus that is well established in terrestrial carnivores (worldwide), as well as bats (but only in the Americas). The other bat lyssaviruses occur only outside the Americas. They have a distinct geographical distribution and association with specific bat species, with limited cross-species transmission to other animals and humans, resulting in deadend infections. The nucleoprotein gene is well conserved between all lyssavirus species. Therefore, gold-standard diagnostic techniques detect all lyssaviruses but do not discriminate between viral species. Lyssaviruses are divided into at least three phylogroups, based on their immunogenic and phylogenic properties. Owing to the diversity of glycoproteins among phylogroups, rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins only provide protection against phylogroup I, excluding several of the bat lyssaviruses. Africa hosts a high diversity of lyssaviruses, leading to the hypothesis that this region was the site of emergence; however, this has been challenged by more recent phylogenetic analysis, suggesting a Palearctic origin. Serological evidence indicates a more widespread and even higher diversity of lyssaviruses in bats, suggesting that the incidence of known lyssaviruses is underestimated and several new lyssavirus species are yet to be discovered. Most bats are, however, not able to transmit the virus and therefore pose a low risk to human and animal populations.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"W Markotter, J Coertse, ",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),NO_DATE,Bat; Chiroptera; Distribution; Diversity; Lyssavirus; Phylogroup; Rabies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747140

We synthesise emerging data to highlight similarities regarding the causes and consequences of dispersal reduction across taxa and ecosystems, as well as the diverse genomic mechanisms underpinning these shifts. Natural selection has acted on standing genetic variation within taxa to drive often rapid - and in some cases parallel - losses of dispersal, and ultimately speciation. Such shifts can thus represent an important nexus between adaptive and neutral diversification processes, with substantial evolutionary consequences.

Especially since COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, Hubei, in December 2019, coronavirus has had a significant impact on people's health and lives. But so far, the pathological diagnosis of COVID-19 has been relatively deficient： it is still confined to the pathological findings of punctured organs, and the majority of medical workers have poor awareness of its pathological characteristics. The COVID-19, as same as SARS and MERS, is caused by coronaviruses and can cause viral pneumonia. They have certain similarities.

124,Human Brown Adipose Tissue Plasticity: Hormonal and Environmental Manipulation,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT), brown-in-white (“brite”) and “beige” adipocytes share the unique ability of converting chemical energy into heat and play a critical role in the adaptive thermogenesis response promoting nonshivering thermogenesis. Uncoupling Protein-1 (UCP1), which allows the uncoupling of substrate oxidation from phosphorylation of ADP, represents the molecular signature of BAT and beige adipocytes. Until recently, the physiologic role of BAT and beige adipocytes depots was thought to be limited to small mammalians and newborns. The discovery of BAT in adult humans and the demonstration of the presence of inducible BAT activity in white adipose tissue by beige adipocytes have generated enthusiasm as potential targets for treatment of obesity and other disorders due to sustained positive energy balance. These findings are particularly important since in vitro studies have demonstrated that preadipocytes can be directed toward a common brown phenotype by multiple pathways that, in turn, may be exploited for therapeutic interventions. In adult humans, BAT activity is more evident in deep neck fat depots and, to a lesser degree, in subcutaneous adipose tissue, with a transcriptome signature resembling the rodent beige fat. This observation supports the hypothesis that human BAT activity and capacity can be modulated. To this end, we have directed our translational research program toward the characterization of beige fat in humans and on the effects of hormonal and environmental drivers in the adaptive thermogenesis response. Mild cold exposure, within the temperature range commonly employed in climate-controlled buildings, is sufficient to generate a significant increase in non-shivering thermogenesis driven by BAT and beige adipocyte activation. In turn, adaptive thermogenesis generates a specific hormonal signature and promotes glucose disposal. Chronic exposure to mild cold induces expansion of BAT mass and activity, whereas exposure to warm climate abrogates them. Additionally, the metabolic effects of BAT mass expansion are evident only upon stimulation of BAT activity, indicating that both expansion and activation of BAT are necessary and complementary strategies to pursue. From an experimental standpoint, human preadipocytes represent a viable experimental platform to mechanistically interrogate different pathways that are able to expand and activate browning. Our laboratory has focused on studying FGF-21, and FNDC5/irisin in their capacity to promote the browning process. Compared to a white differentiation medium, the addition of either FGF-21 or FNDC5 results in a reprogramming toward a brown phenotype, as indicated by the display of brown transcriptome signature and, functionally, by the increase in oxygen consumption following catecholamine treatment, indicating an increase in substrate utilization. Collectively, the integration of a detailed assessment of human physiology with mechanistic observations in cell culture systems can provide a unique opportunity to translate observations from experimental models to actionable therapeutic targets.","['1 Division of Endocrinology Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA']","Francesco S.

125,Revisiting the Role of Hyperparasitism in the Evolution of Virulence,"AbstractHyperparasitism denotes the natural phenomenon where a parasite infecting a host is in turn infected by its own parasite. Hyperparasites can shape the dynamics of host-parasite interactions and often have a deleterious impact on pathogens, an important class of parasites, causing a reduction in their virulence and transmission rate. Hyperparasitism thus could be an important tool of biological control. However, host-parasite-hyperparasite systems have so far been outside the mainstream of modeling studies, especially those dealing with eco-evolutionary aspects of species interactions. Here, we theoretically explore the evolution of life-history traits in a generic host-parasite-hyperparasite system, focusing on parasite virulence and the positive impact that hyperparasitism has on the host population. We also explore the coevolution of life-history traits of the parasite and hyperparasite, using adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics frameworks to identify evolutionarily singular strategies. We find that in the presence of hyperparasites, the evolutionarily optimal pathogen virulence generally shifts toward more virulent strains. However, even in this case the use of hyperparasites in biocontrol could be justified, since overall host mortality decreases. An intriguing possible outcome of the evolution of the hyperparasite can be its evolutionary suicide.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Simran K Sandhu, Andrew Yu Morozov, Robert D Holt, Michael Barfield, ",The American naturalist,NO_DATE,biological control; coevolution; evolutionary attractor; evolutionary suicide; hyperparasite; pairwise invasibility plot (PIP).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33523784

127,Multi-level convergence of complex traits and the evolution of bioluminescence,"Evolutionary convergence provides natural opportunities to investigate how, when, and why novel traits evolve. Many convergent traits are complex, highlighting the importance of explicitly considering convergence at different levels of biological organization, or 'multi-level convergent evolution'. To investigate multi-level convergent evolution, we propose a holistic and hierarchical framework that emphasizes breaking down traits into several functional modules. We begin by identifying long-standing questions on the origins of complexity and the diverse evolutionary processes underlying phenotypic convergence to discuss how they can be addressed by examining convergent systems. We argue that bioluminescence, a complex trait that evolved dozens of times through either novel mechanisms or conserved toolkits, is particularly well suited for these studies. We present an updated estimate of at least 94 independent origins of bioluminescence across the tree of life, which we calculated by reviewing and summarizing all estimates of independent origins. Then, we use our framework to review the biology, chemistry, and evolution of bioluminescence, and for each biological level identify questions that arise from our systematic review. We focus on luminous organisms that use the shared luciferin substrates coelenterazine or vargulin to produce light because these organisms convergently evolved bioluminescent proteins that use the same luciferins to produce bioluminescence. Evolutionary convergence does not necessarily extend across biological levels, as exemplified by cases of conservation and disparity in biological functions, organs, cells, and molecules associated with bioluminescence systems. Investigating differences across bioluminescent organisms will address fundamental questions on predictability and contingency in convergent evolution. Lastly, we highlight unexplored areas of bioluminescence research and advances in sequencing and chemical techniques useful for developing bioluminescence as a model system for studying multi-level convergent evolution.","['1 Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, U.S.A.']","Emily S Lau, Todd H Oakley, ",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,NO_DATE,biological organization; bioluminescence; complex trait; evolution; multi-level convergence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33306257

Bovine coronavirus infection is characterised by high morbidity but low mortality. The laboratory diagnosis is typically based on serological or molecular methods. There is no registered drug for the treatment of virus infections in cattle and we are limited to supportive therapy and preventative measures.

130,Brown Adipose Tissue Energy Metabolism in Humans,"The demonstration of metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans primarily using positron emission tomography coupled to computed tomography (PET/CT) with the glucose tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) has renewed the interest of the scientific and medical community in the possible role of BAT as a target for the prevention and treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we offer a comprehensive review of BAT energy metabolism in humans. Considerable advances in methods to measure BAT energy metabolism, including nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), chylomicron-triglycerides (TG), oxygen, Krebs cycle rate, and intracellular TG have led to very good quantification of energy substrate metabolism per volume of active BAT in vivo. These studies have also shown that intracellular TG are likely the primary energy source of BAT upon activation by cold. Current estimates of BAT's contribution to energy expenditure range at the lower end of what would be potentially clinically relevant if chronically sustained. Yet, 18FDG PET/CT remains the gold-standard defining method to quantify total BAT volume of activity, used to calculate BAT's total energy expenditure. Unfortunately, BAT glucose metabolism better reflects BAT's insulin sensitivity and blood flow. It is now clear that most glucose taken up by BAT does not fuel mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and that BAT glucose uptake can therefore be disconnected from thermogenesis. Furthermore, BAT thermogenesis is efficiently recruited upon repeated cold exposure, doubling to tripling its total oxidative capacity, with reciprocal reduction of muscle thermogenesis. Recent data suggest that total BAT volume may be much larger than the typically observed 50-150 ml with 18FDG PET/CT. Therefore, the current estimates of total BAT thermogenesis, largely relying on total BAT volume using 18FDG PET/CT, may underestimate the true contribution of BAT to total energy expenditure. Quantification of the contribution of BAT to energy expenditure begs for the development of more integrated whole body in vivo methods.","['1 Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Centre de Recherche du CHUS, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.', '2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', '3 Turku PET Centre, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', '4 Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Kuopio, Finland.', ""5 Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada."", '6 Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', '7 Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Centre de Recherche du CHUS, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.']","André C Carpentier, Denis P Blondin, Kirsi A Virtanen, Denis Richard, François Haman, Éric E Turcotte, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2018,brown adipose tissue; energy metabolism; molecular imaging; obesity; positron emission tomography; tracer methods; type 2 diabetes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30131768
131,Effects of exercise on brown and beige adipocytes,"Physical exercise leads to beneficial effects in numerous tissues and organ systems and offers protection against obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have investigated the role of exercise on brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), and have indicated marked adaptations to each tissue with exercise. Studies investigating the effects of exercise on BAT have produced conflicting results, with some showing an increase in the thermogenic activity of BAT and some demonstrating a decrease in the thermogenic activity of BAT. Human studies have observed a down-regulation of BAT activity (measured by a reduction in glucose uptake) in response to exercise. In WAT, exercise decreases adipocyte size, alters gene expression, and increases mitochondrial activity. Transplantation of exercise-trained subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) improves whole-body metabolic health. In rodents, exercise also results in a beiging of scWAT. Thus, exercise-induced changes to adipose tissue may be part of the mechanism by which exercise improves metabolic health.","['1 Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Dorothy M.

132,Switching off the furnace: brown adipose tissue and lactation,"In rodents, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is dynamically regulated by reproductive state, with greater thermogenic activity and capacity outside reproduction and subsequent downregulation of the tissue machinery and function during lactation. We argue that the main reason for BAT to be shut down is the competition between lactogenic (associated with milk synthesis) and thermogenic (associated with BAT activity) heat production within a limited scope for heat dissipation, rather than to spare glucose and lipids for milk production. To add dimension to this competition, we calculate the contribution of lactogenic and thermogenic heat production to daily energy expenditure in mice and estimate the mass-specific heat production in both BAT and mammary glands as 383 and 49 W per kg of tissue, respectively. We have also extracted the original data on BAT characteristics during lactation from 59 papers published over the last four decades and evaluate the direction and magnitude of the changes in various parameters used to describe BAT activity and function across different studies. On average, BAT function during lactation is downregulated by ∼50% when compared with females outside reproduction, both in vivo and in vitro. The level of this downregulation depends on milk production, suggesting the functional link between BAT and mammary glands. Although BAT during lactation responds to various experimental manipulations, these responses are typically reduced to ∼50% of the absolute values achieved outside reproduction, with insulin and noradrenaline resistance being the hallmarks of BAT reduced responsiveness. Unlocking the mechanisms underlying the natural cycles of BAT function and depression during lactation may identify molecular pathways that are important to target when attempts are made to activate BAT in humans.","['1 Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Integrative and Environmental Physiology, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, AB24 2TZ, UK.

133,"Emerging Role of AMPK in Brown and Beige Adipose Tissue (BAT): Implications for Obesity, Insulin Resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes","Purpose of review:
        
      
      The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is escalating at alarming rates, demanding the development of additional classes of therapeutics to further reduce the burden of disease. Recent studies have indicated that increasing the metabolic activity of brown and beige adipose tissue may represent a novel means to reduce circulating glucose and lipids in people with T2D. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor that has recently been demonstrated to be important in potentially regulating the metabolic activity of brown and beige adipose tissue. The goal of this review is to summarize recent work describing the role of AMPK in brown and beige adipose tissue, focusing on its role in adipogenesis and non-shivering thermogenesis. Recent findings:
        
      
      Ablation of AMPK in mouse adipocytes results in cold intolerance, a reduction in non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance; effects associated with a defect in mitochondrial specific autophagy (mitophagy) within BAT. The effects of a β3-adrenergic agonist on the induction of BAT thermogenesis and the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) are also blunted in mice lacking adipose tissue AMPK. A specific AMPK activator, A-769662, also results in the activation of BAT and the browning of WAT, effects which may involve demethylation of the PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16) promoter region, which is important for BAT development. AMPK plays an important role in the development and maintenance of brown and beige adipose tissue. Adipose tissue AMPK is reduced in people with insulin resistance, consistent with findings that mice lacking adipocyte AMPK develop greater NAFLD and insulin resistance. These data suggest that pharmacologically targeting adipose tissue AMPK may represent a promising strategy to enhance energy expenditure and reduce circulating glucose and lipids, which may be effective for the treatment of NAFLD and T2D.","['1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8N 3Z5, Canada.', '2 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8N 3Z5, Canada. gsteinberg@mcmaster.ca.', '3 Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8N 3Z5, Canada. gsteinberg@mcmaster.ca.']","Eric M Desjardins, Gregory R Steinberg, ",Current diabetes reports,2018,AMPK; Adipogenesis; Adipose tissue; Lipolysis; Non-shivering thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30120579
134,ChREBP-β regulates thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a critical role in energy expenditure by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is one of the key transcription factors regulating de novo lipogenesis (DNL). As a constitutively active form, ChREBP-β is expressed at extremely low levels. Up to date, its functional relevance in BAT remains unclear. In this study, we show that ChREBP-β inhibits BAT thermogenesis. BAT ChREBP-β mRNA levels were elevated upon cold exposure, which prompted us to generate a mouse model overexpressing ChREBP-β specifically in BAT using the Cre/LoxP approach. ChREBP-β overexpression led to a whitening phenotype of BAT at room temperature, as evidenced by increased lipid droplet size and decreased mitochondrion content. Moreover, BAT thermogenesis was inhibited upon acute cold exposure, and its metabolic remodeling induced by long-term cold adaptation was significantly impaired by ChREBP-β overexpression. Mechanistically, ChREBP-β overexpression downregulated expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and respiration. Furthermore, thermogenic gene expression (e.g. Dio2, UCP1) was markedly inhibited in BAT by the overexpressed ChREBP-β. Put together, our work points to ChREBP-β as a negative regulator of thermogenesis in brown adipocytes.","['1 Department of Pathophysiology, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', '2 Department of Physiology, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', '3 The State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Center for Life Sciences and Institute of Molecular Medicine, Peking University, Beijing, China.', '4 NHC Key Laboratory of Hormones and Development, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Metabolic Diseases, Tianjin Medical University Chu Hsien-I Memorial Hospital and Tianjin Institute of Endocrinology, Tianjin, China.']","Chunchun Wei, Xianhua Ma, Kai Su, Shasha Qi, Yuangang Zhu, Junjian Lin, Chenxin Wang, Rui Yang, Xiaowei Chen, Weizhong Wang, Weiping J Zhang, ",The Journal of endocrinology,NO_DATE,gene targeting; lipogenesis; metabolism; obesity; transcription factor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32208359

Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.","['1 Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R.

136,Construction of SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particles by Mammalian Expression System,"Virus-like particle (VLP) is a self-assembled nanostructure incorporating key viral structural proteins. VLP resembles molecular and morphological features of authentic viruses but is non-infectious and non-replicating due to lack of genetic materials. Successful applications of VLP has been shown in vaccinological and virological research. As an accessibly safe and relevant substitute of naturally pathogenic viruses, the construction of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs is much in demand in the ongoing fight against 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemics. In the current study, using mammalian expression system, which is advantageous in maintaining correct protein glycosylation patterns, we efficiently constructed SARS-CoV-2 VLPs. We showed that among four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, expression of membrane protein (M) and small envelope protein (E) are essential for efficient formation and release of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs. Moreover, the corona-like structure presented in SARS-CoV-2 VLPs from Vero E6 cells is more stable and unified, as compared to those from HEK-293T cells. Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 VLPs possess molecular and morphological properties of native virion particles, which endow such VLPs with a promising vaccine candidate and a powerful tool for the research of SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Institute of Basic Theory for Chinese Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', '2 Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', ""3 Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""]","Ruodan Xu, Mingfei Shi, Jing Li, Ping Song, Ning Li, ",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2020,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; release; self-assemble; virus-like particles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32850726
137,Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19,"A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016. The protein, known as RBD219-N1 when formulated on Alhydrogel®, induced high-level neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity with minimal immunopathology in mice after a homologous virus challenge with SARS-CoV (MA15 strain). We examined published evidence in support of whether the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 could be repurposed as a heterologous vaccine against Coronavirus Infectious Disease (COVID)-19. Our findings include evidence that convalescent serum from SARS-CoV patients can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a review of published studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against SARS-CoV RBD and that neutralizes the SARS-CoV virus in vitro finds that some of these mAbs bind to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, while others bind to domains outside this region within RBD. This information is relevant and supports the possibility of developing a heterologous SARS-CoV RBD vaccine against COVID-19, especially due to the finding that the overall high amino acid similarity (82%) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD domains is not reflected in RBM amino acid similarity (59%). However, the high sequence similarity (94%) in the region outside of RBM offers the potential of conserved neutralizing epitopes between both viruses.","[""1 Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, Departments of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston, TX, USA."", '2 National School of Tropical Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston, TX, USA.', '3 Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston, TX, USA.']","Wen-Hsiang Chen, Peter J Hotez, Maria Elena Bottazzi, ",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2020,COVID-19; Heterologous vaccine; SARS; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; receptor-binding domain; subunit vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32298218
138,First cryopreservation of phyllostomid bat sperm,"Bats, the second-largest mammalian order, are widely distributed and provide crucial ecosystem services. Their reproductive biology comprises noteworthy characteristics, such as long-term sperm storage, delayed implantation or even delayed fetal development. The understanding of these mechanisms remains limited. Research in reproductive biology may become crucial for the conservation of endangered bat species. Indeed, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species currently lists 76 bat species as endangered or critically endangered, for which conservation measures should be taken. The development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in bats would thus open new perspectives. In this context we here describe the first successful cryopreservation of bat sperm in the Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata). Epididymal sperm of 30 males was pooled in 6 sample sets and diluted using four different cryo-diluents: Canifreeze, modified Canifreeze, BotuCrio® and Test egg yolk extender. Glycerol and a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide were used as cryoprotectants. Best post-thaw results were achieved when sperm was diluted in Test egg yolk extender containing a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide as cryoprotectant. Post-thaw sperm motility, progressive motility and acrosome integrity of 42.0 ± 3.4%, 28.3 ± 6.3% and 87.7 ± 1.7%, respectively were superior to all other variants tested. It remains to be determined if the post-thaw quality of cryopreserved bat spermatozoa achieved in this study is sufficient for the use in artificial inseminations and produces acceptable pregnancy rates. Successful cryopreservation of spermatozoa in C. perspicillata may serve as the first model to establish gamete rescue programs and develop ART in other, critically endangered bat species.","['1 Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, PF 700430, D-10342, Berlin, Germany.

139,An Overview of SARS-CoV-2 and Animal Infection,"A novel coronavirus has been reported as the causative pathogen of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan city, China in December 2019. Due to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide, it has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospitalized patients in Wuhan were associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market where live animals, such as poultry, bats, snakes, frogs, rabbits, marmots, and hedgehogs are sold in that market which suggests a possible zoonotic infection. It was suggested that bat is the natural host of SARS-CoV-2, but the intermediate host is still unclear. It is essential to identify the potential intermediate host to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Pangolin is a highly suspected candidate as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, and lions. More recently SARS-CoV-2 infection affected minks severely and zoonotic transfer with a variant SARS-CoV-2 strain evidenced in Denmark, Netherlands, USA, and Spain suggesting animal-to-human and animal-to-animal transmission within mink farms. Furthermore, experimental studies documented the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2, such as mice, golden hamsters, cats, ferrets, non-human primates, and treeshrews. It is also essential to know the possibility of infection for other animal species. This short review aims to provide an overview on the relation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and animals.","['1 Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', '2 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', '3 Qena University Hospital, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.']","Mohamed A A Mahdy, Waleed Younis, Zamzam Ewaida, ",Frontiers in veterinary science,2020,COVID-19; Intermediate host; SARS-CoV-2; animal; animal model; zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33363234
140,Effect of Iodothyronines on Thermogenesis: Focus on Brown Adipose Tissue,"Thyroid hormones significantly influence energy expenditure by affecting the activity of metabolic active tissues, among which, mammalian brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a significant role. For a long time, the modulation of BAT activity by 3,3',5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) has been ascribed to its direct actions on this tissue; however, recent evidence indicates that T3, by stimulating specific brain centers, activates the metabolism of BAT via the sympathetic nervous system. These distinct mechanisms of action are not mutually exclusive. New evidence indicates that 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (3,5-T2), a thyroid hormone derivative, exerts thermogenic effects, by influencing mitochondrial activity in metabolically active tissues, such as liver, skeletal muscle, and BAT. At the moment, due to the absence of experiments finalized to render a clear cut discrimination between peripheral and central effects induced by 3,5-T2, it is not possible to exclude that some of the metabolic effects exerted by 3,5-T2 may be mediated centrally. Despite this, some evidence suggests that 3,5-T2 plays a role in adrenergic stimulation of thermogenesis in BAT. This mini-review provides an overview of the effects induced by T3 and 3,5-T2 on BAT thermogenesis, with a focus on data suggesting the involvement of central adrenergic stimulation. These aspects may reveal new perspectives in thyroid physiology and in the control of energy metabolism.","['1 Department of Sciences and Technologies, University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy.', '2 Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.']","Federica Cioffi, Alessandra Gentile, Elena Silvestri, Fernando Goglia, Assunta Lombardi, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2018,"3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine; brown adipose tissue; metabolism; thermogenesis; thyroid hormone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29875734
141,Furin Cleavage Site Is Key to SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,"SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and shutdown economies around the world. Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site (ΔPRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the ΔPRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the ΔPRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT 50 ) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT 50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays. Importance:
        
      
      As COVID-19 has impacted the world, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and causes virulence offers potential pathways to disrupt its disease. By removing the furin cleavage site, we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the findings with Vero cells indicate the likelihood of cell culture adaptations in virus stocks that can influence reagent generation and interpretation of a wide range of data including neutralization and drug efficacy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of this key motif in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. Article summary:
        
      
      A deletion of the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 amplifies replication in Vero cells, but attenuates replication in respiratory cells and pathogenesis in vivo.

142,Brown Adipose Tissue: A Potential Site for Islet Transplantation,"Background:
        
      
      Islet transplantation is a promising treatment in patients with complicated diabetes. The ideal transplant site that can extend islet graft survival and reduce the required number of engrafted islets remains to be established. Methods:
        
      
      Donor islets were isolated from red fluorescent protein (RFP) mice and transplanted into interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) or unilateral inguinal white adipose tissue of age-matched diabetic RFP mice. Blood glucose and body weight of the mice were monitored, and vitality and function of ectopic RFP islets were detected by fluorescence imaging, histological examination, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT). Results:
        
      
      BAT enabled the marginal number of grafted islets (80 islets) to restore blood glucose, insulin level, and GTT to normal values in all diabetic recipient mice in the short term after graft, and maintained these values for 1 year at the end of the experiment. Importantly, in the short term after transplantation, abundant extra- and intraislet neovasculatures were observed in BAT, but not in white adipose tissue, which allowed the ectopic islets to retain typical architecture and morphology and contributed to the normal GTT. Moreover, the islet-engrafted BAT displayed normal structure and morphology without significant immunocyte infiltration, and the recipient mice also showed normal lipid levels in the blood. Conclusions:
        
      
      BAT remarkably enhances the viability and biological function of the transplanted ectopic islets. Moreover, the anatomical location of BAT lends itself to biopsy, removal, and islet retransplantation, which strongly suggests the BAT as a potential desirable site for islet transplantation in basic and clinical research.","['1 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Medical Research Center, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China.', '4 Cancer Research Institute, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '5 Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '6 Institute of Comparative Medicine & Laboratory Animal Center, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']","Kang Xu, Raoying Xie, Xiaolin Lin, Junshuang Jia, Nan Zeng, Wangen Li, Dong Xiao, Tao Du, ",Transplantation,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32453253
143,Recent advances in the detection of brown adipose tissue in adult humans: a review,"The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is associated with reductions in circulating lipids and glucose in rodents and contributes to energy expenditure in humans indicating the potential therapeutic importance of targetting this tissue for the treatment of a variety of metabolic disorders. In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human BAT, a variety of methodologies for assessing the volume and metabolic activity of BAT are utilized. Cold exposure is often utilized to increase BAT activity but inconsistencies in the characteristics of the exposure protocols make it challenging to compare findings. The metabolic activity of BAT in response to cold exposure has most commonly been measured by static positron emission tomography of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in combination with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, but recent studies suggest that under some conditions this may not always reflect BAT thermogenic activity. Therefore, recent studies have used alternative positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging strategies and radiotracers that may offer important insights. In addition to PET-CT, there are numerous emerging techniques that may have utility for assessing BAT metabolic activity including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), skin temperature measurements, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and contrast ultrasound (CU). In this review, we discuss and critically evaluate the various methodologies used to measure BAT metabolic activity in humans and provide a contemporary assessment of protocols which may be useful in interpreting research findings and guiding the development of future studies.","['1 Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', '3 Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Centre de recherche du CHUS, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', ""4 Imaging Research Centre, St. Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", '5 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', '6 School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa, 125 University Street, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', '7 Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada gsteinberg@mcmaster.ca kmorrison@mcmaster.ca.', '8 Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada gsteinberg@mcmaster.ca kmorrison@mcmaster.ca.', '9 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']","Frank J Ong, Basma A Ahmed, Stephan M Oreskovich, Denis P Blondin, Tahniyah Haq, Norman B Konyer, Michael D Noseworthy, Francois Haman, Andre C Carpentier, Katherine M Morrison, Gregory R Steinberg, ","Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2018,beige adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue; insulin resistance; obesity; type 2 diabetes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29802209

However, despite promising effects on metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity, no convincing evidence for weight-loss effects of cold-activated human BAT exists to date. Indeed, increasing energy expenditure would naturally induce compensatory feedback mechanisms to defend body weight. Interestingly, BAT is regulated by multiple interactions with the hypothalamus from regions overlapping with centers for feeding behavior and metabolic control. Therefore, in the further exploration of BAT as a potential source of novel drug targets, we discuss the hypothalamic orchestration of BAT activity and the relatively unexplored BAT feedback mechanisms on neuronal regulation. With a holistic view on hypothalamic-BAT interactions, we aim to raise ideas and provide a new perspective on this circuit and highlight its clinical relevance.","['1 Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; email: cs@sund.ku.dk.']","Jo B Henningsen, Camilla Scheele, ",Annual review of physiology,2021,batokines; brown fat; feeding behavior; hypothalamus; obesity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33158377

Based on sonogram analysis, we identified Asellia tridens, Otonycteris hemprichii, and Pipistrellus kuhlii. The most commonly recorded species was Asellia tridens, the only species recorded in the northern half of the country. Contrary to our prediction, the likelihood of recording bats was not higher in the northern half of the country where there are many irrigated farms. The distributions of the bat species may result from differences in human land use and disturbance, and from the distance to the main body of the Arabian Peninsula. A key habitat feature for Asellia tridens and Otonycteris hemprichii may be the presence of roosting sites in less disturbed sinkholes/caves, which are therefore crucial for bat conservation.","['1 Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Qatar University, PO Box 2713, Doha, Qatar.', '2 School of Molecular Sciences, University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley WA 6009, Australia.', '3 Institute of Tropical Biodiversity and Sustainable Development, University Malaysia Terengganu, 21030 Kuala Nerus, Terengganu, Malaysia.']","Maktom Abdulrahman, Andrew Gardner, Nobuyuki Yamaguchi, ",Journal of arid environments,NO_DATE,Asellia tridens; Bat fauna; Otonycteris hemprichii; Pipistrellus kuhlii; Qatar; Sinkhole.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33162623
146,"Biological, clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS and AutoDock simulation of ACE2","Background:
        
      
      The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a public catastrophe and global concern. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory tract infection signs. Almost all populations are susceptible to the virus, and the basic reproduction number (R0) is 2.8-3.9. The fight against COVID-19 should have two aspects: one is the treatment of infected patients, and the other is the mobilization of the society to avoid the spread of the virus. The treatment of patients includes supportive treatment, antiviral treatment, and oxygen therapy. For patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and circulatory support are recommended. Plasma therapy and traditional Chinese medicine have also achieved good outcomes. This review is intended to summarize the research on this new coronavirus, to analyze the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and to provide guidance regarding new methods of prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment based on autodock simulations. Methods:
        
      
      This review compares the multifaceted characteristics of the three coronaviruses including COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Our researchers take the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS as key words and search literatures in the Pubmed database. We compare them horizontally and vertically which respectively means concluding the individual characteristics of each coronavirus and comparing the similarities and differences between the three coronaviruses. Results:
        
      
      We searched for studies on each outbreak and their solutions and found that the main biological differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are in ORF1a and the sequence of gene spike coding protein-S. We also found that the types and severity of clinical symptoms vary, which means that the diagnosis and nursing measures also require differentiation. In addition to the common route of transmission including airborne transmission, these three viruses have their own unique routes of transmission such as fecal-oral route of transmission COVID-19. Conclusions:
        
      
      In evolutionary history, these three coronaviruses have some similar biological features as well as some different mutational characteristics. Their receptors and routes of transmission are not all the same, which makes them different in clinical features and treatments. We discovered through the autodock simulations that Met124 plays a key role in the efficiency of drugs targeting ACE2, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, ciclesonide and niclosamide, and may be a potential target in COVID-19.","['1 Department of Pediatrics, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410013, Hunan, China.', '2 Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, 410013, Hunan, China.', ""3 Guangdong Cardiovascular Institute, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, 510100, Guangdong, China."", ""4 Guangdong Cardiovascular Institute, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, 510100, Guangdong, China. tanganqier@163.com."", '5 Department of Pediatrics, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410013, Hunan, China. 36163773@qq.com.']","Xue-Yan Zhang, Hao-Jie Huang, Dong-Lin Zhuang, Moussa Ide Nasser, Ming-Hua Yang, Ping Zhu, Ming-Yi Zhao, ",Infectious diseases of poverty,2020,Autodock; COVID-19; Coronavirus; MERS; SARS.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32690096
147,Perspectives on monoclonal antibody therapy as potential therapeutic intervention for Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19),"Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.","['1 Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '2 Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '3 Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']","Balamurugan Shanmugaraj, Konlavat Siriwattananon, Kittikhun Wangkanont, Waranyoo Phoolcharoen, ",Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134278
148,Hunting Bats for Human Consumption in Bangladesh,"Bats are important wildlife to their ecologic system, but they are also a zoonotic disease reservoir. Close bat-human interaction can lead to pathogen spillover. We conducted a qualitative study in two districts of Bangladesh and interviewed 30 bat hunters who hunt bats primarily for consumption, to understand the process and their reasons for hunting bats and their perceptions about bats and bat-borne disease. Most hunters catch bats during winter nights, using a net. Bat meat is used for household consumption, and the surplus is sold to cover household expenditures. They prepare the bat meat at home to sell it in their own and in neighboring communities. They also sell live bats to traditional healers. They report that the bat population has declined compared with 5 or 10 years ago, a decline they attribute to hunting and deforestation. Many have heard of a disease from bat-contaminated date palm sap but do not believe that bats can spread such disease to humans. Close bat-human interaction reported in this study pose a risk of pathogen spillover. Conservation initiatives have the potential to reduce such interaction and so both reduce disease risk and support the ecology.","['1 icddr,b, 68, Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Mohakhali, Dhaka, 1212, Bangladesh. nahar.nazmun@yahoo.com.', '2 Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland. nahar.nazmun@yahoo.com.', '3 University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. nahar.nazmun@yahoo.com.', '4 icddr,b, 68, Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Mohakhali, Dhaka, 1212, Bangladesh.', '5 Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.', '6 Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '7 FHI 360, Washington, DC, USA.', '8 Section for Global Health, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', '9 Institute of Health Economics, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '10 Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']","Nazmun Nahar, Mohammad Asaduzzaman, Utpal Kumar Mandal, Nadia Ali Rimi, Emily S Gurley, Mahmudur Rahman, Fernando Garcia, Susan Zimicki, Rebeca Sultana, Stephen P Luby, ",EcoHealth,NO_DATE,Bangladesh; Bats; Hunting; Nipah virus infection; Qualitative research; Zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31989365
149,Environmental Pollutants Effect on Brown Adipose Tissue,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) with its thermogenic function due to the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), has been positively associated with improved resistance to obesity and metabolic diseases. During recent years, the potential influence of environmental pollutants on energetic homoeostasis and obesity development has drawn increased attention. The purpose of this review is to discuss how regulation of BAT function could be involved in the environmental pollutant effect on body energy metabolism. We mainly focused in reviewing studies on animal models, which provide a better insight into the cellular mechanisms involved in this effect on body energy metabolism. The current literature supports the hypothesis that some environmental pollutants, acting as endocrine disruptors (EDCs), such as dichlorodiphenyltrichoroethane (DDT) and its metabolite dichlorodiphenylethylene (DDE) as well as some, traffic pollutants, are associated with increased obesity risk, whereas some other chemicals, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), had a reverse association with obesity. Noteworthy, the EDCs associated with obesity and metabolic disorders impaired BAT mass and function. Perinatal exposure to DDT impaired BAT thermogenesis and substrate utilization, increasing susceptibility to metabolic syndrome. Ambient particulate air pollutions induced insulin resistance associated with BAT mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, the environmental pollutants (PFOS/PFOA) elicited a reduction in body weight and adipose mass associated with upregulation of UCP1 and increased oxidative capacity in brown-fat mitochondria. Further research is needed to better understand the physiological role of BAT in response to exposure to both obesogenic and anti-obesogenic pollutants and to confirm the same role in humans.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biology ""A.

152,Functional characterization of human brown adipose tissue metabolism,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has long been described according to its histological features as a multilocular, lipid-containing tissue, light brown in color, that is also responsive to the cold and found especially in hibernating mammals and human infants. Its presence in both hibernators and human infants, combined with its function as a heat-generating organ, raised many questions about its role in humans. Early characterizations of the tissue in humans focused on its progressive atrophy with age and its apparent importance for cold-exposed workers. However, the use of positron emission tomography (PET) with the glucose tracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) made it possible to begin characterizing the possible function of BAT in adult humans, and whether it could play a role in the prevention or treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This review focuses on the in vivo functional characterization of human BAT, the methodological approaches applied to examine these features and addresses critical gaps that remain in moving the field forward. Specifically, we describe the anatomical and biomolecular features of human BAT, the modalities and applications of non-invasive tools such as PET and magnetic resonance imaging coupled with spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) to study BAT morphology and function in vivo, and finally describe the functional characteristics of human BAT that have only been possible through the development and application of such tools.","[""1 Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Centre d'imagerie moléculaire de Sherbrooke, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada."", '2 Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.', '3 Department of Nutrition and Movement Sciences, NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.', '4 Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.']","Marie Anne Richard, Hannah Pallubinsky, Denis P Blondin, ",The Biochemical journal,2020,bioenergetics; brown adipose tissue; lipid metabolism; positron emission tomography; thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32271883
153,"Neuregulin 4: A ""Hotline"" Between Brown Fat and Liver","The discovery that functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans is inversely related to body fat mass and may reflect metabolic health has stimulated adipose tissue research to explore activation of BAT as a potential target for antiobesity treatments. In addition to the capacity of BAT to increase energy expenditure and glucose and lipid uptake, BAT secretes factors that may contribute to the regulation of whole-body metabolism. Among signals released from BAT, neuregulin 4 (NRG4) has been recently identified as an endocrine factor that may link the activation of BAT to protection against diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. NRG4 was shown to directly reduce lipogenesis in hepatocytes, and it could indirectly activate BAT via sympathetic neurons or via inducing brown adipocyte-like signatures in white adipocytes in a paracrine manner. However, the potential relevance of NRG4 as a diagnostic tool or target for the treatment of obesity-related diseases remains to be explored.","['1 Department of Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']","Matthias Blüher, ","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31479202
154,Reliability and Feasibility of the Self-Administered ISTH-Bleeding Assessment Tool,"Introduction Standardized bleeding assessment tools (BATs), such as the International Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH)-BAT, are screening instruments used during the diagnostic workup of suspected bleeding disorders. A self-administered ISTH-BAT (self-BAT) would enhance screening and save time during an outpatient clinic visit. Aim This study was aimed to investigate the reliability and feasibility of the self-BAT. Methods The electronic self-BAT was created from the ISTH-BAT and paper-version of self-BAT and optimized by patients and physicians. Patients with a (suspected) congenital platelet defect (CPD), who had previously undergone physician-administered ISTH-BAT assessment, were invited to complete the self-BAT. Optimal self-BAT cut-off values to detect a bleeding tendency, as defined by the ISTH-BAT, were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to reach a sensitivity ≥95%. Reliability was tested by assessing sensitivity, specificity, and intraclass correlation (ICC). Feasibility was evaluated on comprehension and length of self-BAT. Results Both versions of the BAT were completed by 156 patients. Optimal cut-off values for self-BAT to define a bleeding tendency were found to be identical to those of the ISTH-BAT. Normal/abnormal scores of the ISTH-BAT and self-BAT were agreed in 88.5% (138/156, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.93) of patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the self-BAT to detect a bleeding tendency were 96.9 and 48.1%, respectively. The ICC was 0.73. Self-BAT questions were graded by 96.8% (151/156) as ""very easy,"" ""easy,"" and ""satisfactory"" and questionnaire length as ""exactly right"" by 91% (142/156) of patients. Conclusion In patients with a (suspected) CPD, the self-BAT is sufficiently reliable and feasible to detect a bleeding tendency, which supports its use as a screening tool.","['1 Van Creveldkliniek, University Medical Center Utrecht, University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', '2 Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']","Marieke C Punt, Maaike W Blaauwgeers, Merel A Timmer, Paco M J Welsing, Roger E G Schutgens, Karin P M van Galen, ",TH open : companion journal to thrombosis and haemostasis,2019,ISTH-BAT; bleeding tendency; congenital platelet defects; self-BAT.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31799494
155,Two Detailed Plaque Assay Protocols for the Quantification of Infectious SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causal agent of COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19), an atypical pneumonia-like syndrome that emerged in December 2019. While SARS-CoV-2 titers can be measured by detection of viral nucleic acid, this method is unable to quantitate infectious virions. Measurement of infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50 ), which detects the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in cells infected with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. However, this method only provides a qualitative infectious virus titer. Plaque assays are a quantitative method of measuring infectious SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying the plaques formed in cell culture upon infection with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. As such, plaque assays remain the gold standard in quantifying concentrations of replication-competent lytic virions. Here, we describe two detailed plaque assay protocols to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 using different overlay and staining methods. Both methods have several advantages and disadvantages, which can be considered when choosing the procedure best suited for each laboratory. These assays can be used for several research purposes, including titration of virus stocks produced from infected cell supernatant and, with further optimization, quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from infected animals. © 2019 The Authors.

156,Role of Brown Adipose Tissue in Adiposity Associated With Narcolepsy Type 1,"Narcolepsy type 1 is a neurological sleep-wake disorder caused by the destruction of orexin (hypocretin)-producing neurons. These neurons are particularly located in the lateral hypothalamus and have widespread projections throughout the brain, where they are involved, e.g., in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and appetite. Interestingly, a higher prevalence of obesity has been reported in patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to healthy controls, despite a normal to decreased food intake and comparable physical activity. This suggests the involvement of tissues implicated in total energy expenditure, including skeletal muscle, liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Recent evidence from pre-clinical studies with orexin knock-out mice demonstrates a crucial role for the orexin system in the functionality of brown adipose tissue (BAT), probably through multiple pathways. Since BAT is a highly metabolically active organ that combusts fatty acids and glucose toward heat, thereby contributing to energy metabolism, this raises the question of whether BAT plays a role in the development of obesity and related metabolic diseases in narcolepsy type 1. BAT is densely innervated by the sympathetic nervous system that activates BAT, for instance, following cold exposure. The sympathetic outflow toward BAT is mainly mediated by the dorsomedial, ventromedial, arcuate, and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus. This review focuses on the current knowledge on the role of the orexin system in the control of energy balance, with specific focus on BAT metabolism and adiposity in both preclinical and clinical studies.","['1 Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', '2 Einthoven Laboratory for Experimental Vascular Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', '3 Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', '4 Sleep Wake Centre SEIN, Heemstede, Netherlands.']","Maaike E Straat, Mink S Schinkelshoek, Rolf Fronczek, Gerrit Jan Lammers, Patrick C N Rensen, Mariëtte R Boon, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,brown adipose tissue; energy metabolism; hypothalamus; narcolepsy type 1; obesity; orexin; sympathetic nervous system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32373062
157,The Remaining Mysteries about Brown Adipose Tissues,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is a thermogenic fat tissue originally discovered in small hibernating mammals, is believed to exert anti-obesity effects in humans. Although evidence has been accumulating to show the importance of BAT in metabolism regulation, there are a number of unanswered questions. In this review, we show the remaining mysteries about BATs. The distribution of BAT can be visualized by nuclear medicine examinations; however, the precise localization of human BAT is not yet completely understood. For example, studies of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scans have shown that interscapular BAT (iBAT), the largest BAT in mice, exists only in the neonatal period or in early infancy in humans. However, an old anatomical study illustrated the presence of iBAT in adult humans, suggesting that there is a discrepancy between anatomical findings and imaging data. It is also known that BAT secretes various metabolism-improving factors, which are collectively called as BATokines. With small exceptions, however, their main producers are not BAT per se, raising the possibility that there are still more BATokines to be discovered. Although BAT is conceived as a favorable tissue from the standpoint of obesity prevention, it is also involved in the development of unhealthy conditions such as cancer cachexia. In addition, a correlation between browning of mammary gland and progression of breast cancers was shown in a xenotransplantation model. Therefore, the optimal condition should be carefully determined when BAT is considered as a measure the prevention of obesity and improvement of metabolism. Solving BAT mysteries will open a new door for health promotion via advanced understanding of metabolism regulation system.","['1 Department of Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', '2 Department of Regenerative Medicine, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.']","Miwako Nishio, Kumiko Saeki, ",Cells,2020,BATokine; brown adipose tissue; cachexia; extracellular vesicles; interscapular BAT; trapezius muscle.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33182625

159,Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and their inactivation with biocidal agents,"Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.","['1 University Medicine Greifswald, Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Straße, 17475 Greifswald, Germany.

160,Optogenetic-induced sympathetic neuromodulation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis,"The brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ that plays a major role in energy balance, obesity, and diabetes due to the potent glucose and lipid clearance that fuels its thermogenesis, which is largely mediated via sympathetic nervous system activation. However, thus far there has been little experimental validation of the hypothesis that selective neuromodulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating the BAT is sufficient to elicit thermogenesis in mice. We generated mice expressing blue light-activated channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the sympathetic nerves innervating the BAT using two different strategies: injecting the BAT of C57Bl/6J mice with AAV6-hSyn-ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP; crossbreeding tyrosine hydroxylase-Cre mice with floxed-stop ChR2-EYFP mice. The nerves in the BAT expressing ChR2 were selectively stimulated with a blue LED light positioned underneath the fat pad of anesthetized mice, while the BAT and core temperatures were simultaneously recorded. Using immunohistochemistry we confirmed the selective expression of EYFP in TH positive nerves fibers. In addition, local optogenetic stimulation of the sympathetic nerves induced significant increase in the BAT temperature followed by an increase in core temperature in mice expressing ChR2, but not in the respective controls. The BAT activation was also paralleled by increased levels of pre-UCP1 transcript. Our results demonstrate that local optogenetic stimulation of the sympathetic nerves is sufficient to elicit BAT and core thermogenesis, thus suggesting that peripheral neuromodulation has the potential to be exploited as an alternative to pharmacotherapies to elicit organ activation and thus ameliorate type 2 diabetes and/or obesity.","['1 Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', '2 Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', '3 Department of Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', '4 Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', '5 Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', '6 University Imaging Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']","Carey E Lyons, Maria Razzoli, Erin Larson, Daniel Svedberg, Andrea Frontini, Saverio Cinti, Lucy Vulchanova, Mark Sanders, Mark Thomas, Alessandro Bartolomucci, ",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,NO_DATE,AAV6; CLARITY; UCP1; opsin; peripheral nervous system.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31908033

The rapid development of an effective vaccine is imperative to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A number of concurrent efforts to find an effective therapeutic agent or vaccine for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are being undertaken globally. Oral and nasal mucosal surfaces serve as the primary portal of entry for pathogens like coronaviruses in the human body. As evidenced by studies on similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), mucosal vaccination can provide a safe and effective means for the induction of long-lasting systemic and mucosal immunity to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2. This article summarizes the approaches to an effective mucosal vaccine formulation which can be a rewarding approach to combat the unprecedented threat posed by this emerging global pandemic.","['1 Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee , Roorkee, India.']","Rajat Mudgal, Sanketkumar Nehul, Shailly Tomar, ",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2020,Coronavirus; Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; mucosal vaccine; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32931361
162,Shared PPARα/γ Target Genes Regulate Brown Adipocyte Thermogenic Function,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) generates heat to maintain body temperature and suppress obesity. Agonists for nuclear receptors PPARα and PPARγ both affect brown adipocyte function, yet the interplay between these factors in BAT is uncertain. Here, we report that PPARα shares most genomic binding sites with PPARγ, and these common binding sites are more related to BAT function than PPARγ-selective sites without PPARα. Integrating PPARα and PPARγ genomic occupancy with cold-responsive BAT transcriptomes identifies a subset of 16 genes with potential relevance to BAT function. Among these, we focused on the lysosomal protease cathepsin Z (CTSZ) and showed it is necessary for mitochondrial respiration in both mouse and human brown adipocytes. Thus, CTSZ is a shared PPARα/γ target gene in BAT and a regulator of brown adipocyte thermogenic function.","['1 Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '2 Research and Development BioRestorative Therapies, New York, NY 11747, USA.', '3 Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', '4 Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

163,Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19): Are they similar?,"SARS-CoV-2 has radically changed our lives causing hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide and influencing our lifestyle and habits. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a disease of felids caused by the feline coronaviruses (FCoV). FIP has been considered irremediably deadly until the last few years. Being one of the numerous coronaviruses that are well known in veterinary medicine, information on FCoV could be of interest and might give suggestions on pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that are still unclear. The authors of this paper describe the most important aspects of FIP and COVID-19 and the similarities and differences between these important diseases. SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV are taxonomically distant viruses, and recombination events with other coronaviruses have been reported for FCoV and have been suggested for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV differ in terms of some pathogenic, clinical and pathological features. However, some of the pathogenic and immunopathogenic events that are well known in cats FIP seem to be present also in people with COVID-19. Moreover, preventive measures currently recommended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading have been shown to allow eradication of FIP in feline households. Finally, one of the most promising therapeutic compounds against FIP, GS-441524, is the active form of Remdesivir, which is being used as one therapeutic option for COVID-19.","['1 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Lodi, Italy.', '2 Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Milan, Lodi, Italy.']","Saverio Paltrinieri, Alessia Giordano, Angelica Stranieri, Stefania Lauzi, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,NO_DATE,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; feline coronavirus; feline infectious peritonitis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32985113
164,Immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: A rapid review,"In this review, we systematically searched and summarized the evidence on the immune response and reinfection rate following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also retrieved studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to assess the long-term duration of antibody responses. A protocol based on Cochrane rapid review methodology was adhered to and databases were searched from 1/1/2000 until 26/5/2020. Of 4744 citations retrieved, 102 studies met our inclusion criteria. Seventy-four studies were retrieved on SARS-CoV-2. While the rate and timing of IgM and IgG seroconversion were inconsistent across studies, most seroconverted for IgG within 2 weeks and 100% (N = 62) within 4 weeks. IgG was still detected at the end of follow-up (49-65 days) in all patients (N = 24). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 92%-100% of patients (up to 53 days). It is not clear if reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is possible, with studies more suggestive of intermittent detection of residual RNA. Twenty-five studies were retrieved on SARS-CoV. In general, SARS-CoV-specific IgG was maintained for 1-2 years post-infection and declined thereafter, although one study detected IgG up to 12 years post-infection. Neutralizing antibodies were detected up to 17 years in another study. Three studies on MERS-CoV reported that IgG may be detected up to 2 years. In conclusion, limited early data suggest that most patients seroconvert for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG within 2 weeks. While the long-term duration of antibody responses is unknown, evidence from SARS-CoV studies suggest SARS-CoV-specific IgG is sustained for 1-2 years and declines thereafter.","['1 Health Technology Assessment Directorate, Health Information and Quality Authority, Dublin 7, Ireland.', '2 The Centre for Health Policy and Management, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.', '3 School of Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', '4 UCD National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland.', '5 Department of Clinical Immunology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, Ireland.', '6 Department of General Practice, Health Research Board Centre for Primary Care Research, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin 2, Ireland.', '7 Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Trinity Health Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 8, Ireland.']","Eamon O Murchu, Paula Byrne, Kieran A Walsh, Paul G Carty, Máire Connolly, Cillian De Gascun, Karen Jordan, Mary Keoghan, Kirsty K O'Brien, Michelle O'Neill, Susan M Smith, Conor Teljeur, Máirín Ryan, Patricia Harrington, ",Reviews in medical virology,NO_DATE,COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; seasonal coronaviruses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32964627
165,Far-UVC light (222 nm) efficiently and safely inactivates airborne human coronaviruses,"A direct approach to limit airborne viral transmissions is to inactivate them within a short time of their production. Germicidal ultraviolet light, typically at 254 nm, is effective in this context but, used directly, can be a health hazard to skin and eyes. By contrast, far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens potentially without harm to exposed human tissues. We previously demonstrated that 222-nm far-UVC light efficiently kills airborne influenza virus and we extend those studies to explore far-UVC efficacy against airborne human coronaviruses alpha HCoV-229E and beta HCoV-OC43. Low doses of 1.7 and 1.2 mJ/cm2 inactivated 99.9% of aerosolized coronavirus 229E and OC43, respectively. As all human coronaviruses have similar genomic sizes, far-UVC light would be expected to show similar inactivation efficiency against other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Based on the beta-HCoV-OC43 results, continuous far-UVC exposure in occupied public locations at the current regulatory exposure limit (~3 mJ/cm2/hour) would result in ~90% viral inactivation in ~8 minutes, 95% in ~11 minutes, 99% in ~16 minutes and 99.9% inactivation in ~25 minutes. Thus while staying within current regulatory dose limits, low-dose-rate far-UVC exposure can potentially safely provide a major reduction in the ambient level of airborne coronaviruses in occupied public locations.","['1 Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA.', '2 Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA. djb3@cumc.columbia.edu.']","Manuela Buonanno, David Welch, Igor Shuryak, David J Brenner, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581288

167,Potential therapeutic effects of Resveratrol against SARS-CoV-2,"Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 or Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are human pathogens. Current pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 represents a major health problem worldwide, with over four million cases and more than 300,000 deaths in the world. Development of effective therapy thus became an emergency. This report aims to highlight Resveratrol as possible therapeutic candidate in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral efficacy of Resveratrol was demonstrated for several viruses, including coronavirus. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release. It was also reported to promote SIRT1 and p53 signaling pathways and increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) immune cells. In addition, Resveratrol was demonstrated to be a stimulator of fetal hemoglobin and a potent antioxidant, by trapping reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to these reports, Resveratrol could be proposed as potential therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

168,Hosts and Sources of Endemic Human Coronaviruses,"The four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children. While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics. For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents. HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses. HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine. The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century. New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.","['1 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Berlin, Germany.', '2 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany.', '3 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Berlin, Germany.

170,Brown adipose tissue ameliorates autoimmune arthritis via inhibition of Th17 cells,"The functions of adipose tissue are associated with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some studies have shown that the three compositions of adipose tissue (white, brown, and beige) have different functions. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is known to secrete several factors that differ from those in white adipose tissue. This suggests that BAT might have potential positive advantages in the physiology of autoimmune diseases. We compared the functions of collagen-induced arthritis mice-derived BAT (CIA BAT) with normal mice-derived BAT. DBA/1J mice (6-7 weeks of age) were immunized by intradermal injection at the base of the tail with 100 μg of bovine type II collagen (CII) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Immunized mice then received booster immunizations by intraperitoneal injection with 100 μg of CII in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. We transplanted CIA BAT and normal BAT into CIA recipient mice. After transplantation, we measured the functions of CIA BAT and normal BAT in mice. Normal BAT-transplanted mice showed significantly lower scores of bone damage, inflammation, and cartilage damage. The proinflammatory cytokines in normal BAT-transplanted mice, such as IL-12, IL-17, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), tended to decrease. Microarray analysis showed that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and IL-17 levels of CIA BAT tissues were significantly higher than those of normal BAT tissues. These results suggest that the transplantation of normal brown fat may have a therapeutic effect in RA patients.","['1 Laboratory of Immune Network, Conversant Research Consortium in Immunologic Disease, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', '2 Cellular Reprogramming and Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Dental Research Institute, BK21 PLUS Dental Life Science, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea.', '3 Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-Daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', '4 College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.', '5 Impact Biotech, Korea 505 Banpo-dong, Seocho-ku, Seoul, 137-040, Republic of Korea.', ""6 Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea."", '7 Cellular Reprogramming and Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Dental Research Institute, BK21 PLUS Dental Life Science, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea. sangho@snu.ac.kr.', '8 Laboratory of Immune Network, Conversant Research Consortium in Immunologic Disease, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. iammila@catholic.ac.kr.', '9 Rheumatism Research Center, Catholic Research Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-Daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea. iammila@catholic.ac.kr.', '10 Department of Medical Lifescience, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222, Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. iammila@catholic.ac.kr.']","Jeonghyeon Moon, Dasom Kim, Eun Kyung Kim, Seon-Yeong Lee, Hyun Sik Na, Gyoung Nyun Kim, Aram Lee, KyungAh Jung, Jeong Won Choi, Sung-Hwan Park, Sangho Roh, Mi-La Cho, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32704024
171,Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is changing the world like never before. This crisis is unlikely contained in the absence of effective therapeutics or vaccine. The papain-like protease (PLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays essential roles in virus replication and immune evasion, presenting a charming drug target. Given the PLpro proteases of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share significant homology, inhibitor developed for SARS-CoV PLpro is a promising starting point of therapeutic development. In this study, we sought to provide structural frameworks for PLpro inhibitor design. We determined the unliganded structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro mutant C111S, which shares many structural features of SARS-CoV PLpro. This crystal form has unique packing, high solvent content and reasonable resolution 2.5 Å, hence provides a good possibility for fragment-based screening using crystallographic approach. We characterized the protease activity of PLpro in cleaving synthetic peptide harboring nsp2/nsp3 juncture. We demonstrate that a potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor GRL0617 is highly effective in inhibiting protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 with the IC50 of 2.2 ± 0.3 μmol/L. We then determined the structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro complexed by GRL0617 to 2.6 Å, showing the inhibitor accommodates the S3-S4 pockets of the substrate binding cleft. The binding of GRL0617 induces closure of the BL2 loop and narrows the substrate binding cleft, whereas the binding of a tetrapeptide substrate enlarges the cleft. Hence, our results suggest a mechanism of GRL0617 inhibition, that GRL0617 not only occupies the substrate pockets, but also seals the entrance to the substrate binding cleft hence prevents the binding of the LXGG motif of the substrate.","['1 NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.', '2 The Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen 5232, Switzerland.']","Xiaopan Gao, Bo Qin, Pu Chen, Kaixiang Zhu, Pengjiao Hou, Justyna Aleksandra Wojdyla, Meitian Wang, Sheng Cui, ",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

172,A Novel PET Probe for Brown Adipose Tissue Imaging in Rodents,"Purpose:
        
      
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as a promising target to counteract obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. However, the detection of this tissue remains one of the major roadblocks. Procedures:
        
      
      In this study, we assess the use of BODIPY 1 as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent to image BAT depots in vivo in two mouse phenotypes: obesity-resistant BALB/c mice and the obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. [18F]BODIPY 1 is a radioactive dye that processed both radioactivity for PET imaging and fluorescence signal for in vitro mechanism study. Results:
        
      
      Through the co-staining of cancer cells with BODIPY 1 and MitoTracker, we found BODIPY 1 mainly accumulated in cell mitochondria in vitro. Fluorescence imaging of primary brown and white adipocytes further confirmed BODIPY 1 had significantly higher accumulation in primary brown adipocytes compared with primary white adipocytes. We evaluated [18F]BODIPY 1 for BAT imaging in both obesity-resistant BALB/c mice and obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. Indeed, [18F]BODIPY 1 was efficiently taken up by BAT in both mouse genotypes (6.40 ± 1.98 %ID/g in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice (n = 8) and 5.37 ± 0.82 %ID/g in obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice (n = 7)). Although norepinephrine stimulation could increase the absolute BAT uptake, the enhancement is not significant in both genotypes (p > 0.05) at current sample size. These results suggest BAT uptake of [18F]BODIPY 1 may be independent of BAT thermogenic activity. As a comparison, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET imaging was performed in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice. Significantly increased uptake was observed in adrenergically activated BAT (10.08 ± 2.52 %ID/g, n = 3) but not in inactive BAT (3.803 ± 0.70 %ID/g; n = 3). Because [18F]BODIPY 1 maintained its fluorescent property, BAT tissue was excised and studied using fluorescence microscopy. Strong fluorescence signal was observed in BAT mouse that was injected with BODIPY 1. Conclusions:
        
      
      Unlike [18F]FDG, [18F]BODIPY 1 showed prominent accumulation in BAT under both inactive and stimulated status. [18F]BODIPY 1 may serve as a valuable BAT PET agent to possibly assess BAT mitochondria density, thus BAT thermogenic capacity after further evaluation.","['1 Department of Radiology and Biomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.', '2 Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', '3 Biomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.', '4 Department of Chemistry, Bio-Imaging Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.', '5 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.', '6 Department of Radiology and Biomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA. zhanhong_wu@med.unc.edu.', '7 Biomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA. zhanhong_wu@med.unc.edu.']","Hui Wang, Mengzhe Wang, Kantapat Chansaenpak, Yang Liu, Hong Yuan, Jin Xie, Hang Yin, Rosa T Branca, Zibo Li, Zhanhong Wu, ",Molecular imaging and biology,NO_DATE,BODIPY; Brown adipose tissue; Positron emission tomography; Thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31520279
173,Mechanisms of Impaired Brown Adipose Tissue Recruitment in Obesity,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy to produce heat. Thus, it has the potential to regulate body temperature by thermogenesis. For the last decade, BAT has been in the spotlight due to its rediscovery in adult humans. This is evidenced by over a hundred clinical trials that are currently registered to target BAT as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. The goal of most of these trials is to activate the BAT thermogenic program via several approaches such as adrenergic stimulation, natriuretic peptides, retinoids, capsinoids, thyroid hormones, or glucocorticoids. However, the impact of BAT activation on total body energy consumption and the potential effect on weight loss is still limited. Other studies have focused on increasing the mass of thermogenic BAT. This can be relevant in obesity, where the activity and abundance of BAT have been shown to be drastically reduced. The aim of this review is to describe pathological processes associated with obesity that may influence the correct differentiation of BAT, such as catecholamine resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. This will shed light on the thermogenic potential of BAT as a therapeutic approach to target obesity-induced metabolic diseases.","['1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy, Institut de Biomedicina de la Universitat de Barcelona (IBUB), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', '3 Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y la Nutrición (CIBEROBN), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']","Martín Alcalá, María Calderon-Dominguez, Dolors Serra, Laura Herrero, Marta Viana, ",Frontiers in physiology,2019,BAT recruitment; catecholamine; differentiation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; inflammation; obesity; oxidative stress; preadipocyte.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30814954

We conducted an Internet survey to confirm the validity and reliability of the BAT-J, using registered monitors from a Japanese survey company. The first-wave survey was conducted in May 2018, with 1,032 monitors. Of these, 498 participated in the second-wave survey in June 2018 to confirm 1-month test-retest reliability. We examined the factorial validity of the BAT-J core symptoms (BAT-JC) and BAT-J secondary symptoms (BAT-JS), as well as their reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and construct validity.

Convergent and discriminant validity were examined using multitrait-multimethod frameworks well as the average variance explained. Exploratory structural equation modeling bifactor solutions for the BAT-JC, BAT-JS, and BAT-J demonstrated the best fit to the data. They also indicated that the general factor accounted for over two-thirds of the common variance explained. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were confirmed. Convergent and internal discriminant validity of the BAT-JC were confirmed vis-ȧ-vis burnout, as assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey. Moreover, external discriminant validity of the BAT-J was demonstrated for work engagement and workaholism.

Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.","['1 Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau SPR, China.', '2 Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau SPR, China.']","Guangyu Zhou, Qi Zhao, ",International journal of biological sciences,2020,COVID-19; Neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32226289
177,Tools to study pathogen-host interactions in bats,"Bats are natural reservoirs for a variety of emerging viruses that cause significant disease in humans and domestic animals yet rarely cause clinical disease in bats. The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.","['1 Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', '2 Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Arthropod-borne and Infectious Diseases laboratory, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, USA.', '3 CSIRO, Health and Biosecurity Business Unit, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia.

178,Development and Evolution through the Lens of Global Gene Regulation,"Evolution and development are two inherently intertwined processes. As the embryo develops it does so in ways that both reflect past constraints and bias the future evolution of the species. While research exploiting this insight typically studies individual genes, transcriptomic analyses have sparked a new wave of discoveries. In this opinion piece, I review the evidence arising from transcriptomics on the topics of the evolution of germ layers, the phylotypic stage, and developmental constraints. The spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression across germ layers provides evidence that the endoderm was the first germ layer to evolve. Comparing transcriptome dynamics throughout developmental time across distant species reveals a mid-developmental transition under strong developmental constraints. These studies highlight the efficiency of exploratory data analysis using computational tools and comparative approaches for discovery.","['1 Institute for Computational Medicine, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.

179,The genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 does not rule out a laboratory origin: SARS-COV-2 chimeric structure and furin cleavage site might be the result of genetic manipulation,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2's origin is still controversial. Genomic analyses show SARS-CoV-2 likely to be chimeric, most of its sequence closest to bat CoV RaTG13, whereas its receptor binding domain (RBD) is almost identical to that of a pangolin CoV. Chimeric viruses can arise via natural recombination or human intervention. The furin cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 confers to the virus the ability to cross species and tissue barriers, but was previously unseen in other SARS-like CoVs. Might genetic manipulations have been performed in order to evaluate pangolins as possible intermediate hosts for bat-derived CoVs that were originally unable to bind to human receptors? Both cleavage site and specific RBD could result from site-directed mutagenesis, a procedure that does not leave a trace. Considering the devastating impact of SARS-CoV-2 and importance of preventing future pandemics, researchers have a responsibility to carry out a thorough analysis of all possible SARS-CoV-2 origins.","['1 Department of Microbiology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', '2 Youthereum Genetics Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","Rossana Segreto, Yuri Deigin, ","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",NO_DATE,BtCov/4991; Gain-of-function studies; RaTG13; SARS-CoV-2; furin cleavage site; pangolin CoV; receptor binding domain.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33200842
180,Coronavirus envelope protein: current knowledge,"Background:
        
      
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins. Main body:
        
      
      This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge. It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings. Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research. Conclusions:
        
      
      The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis. Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates. The high mortality rate of certain CoVs, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into CoV molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.","['1 Molecular Biology and Virology Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Biosciences, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa.', '2 Molecular Biology and Virology Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Biosciences, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa. bfielding@uwc.ac.za.']","Dewald Schoeman, Burtram C Fielding, ",Virology journal,2019,Assembly; Budding; Coronavirus; Envelope protein; Topology; Viroporin.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31133031

One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.","['1 College of Biological Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.

182,Probable Pangolin Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Associated with the COVID-19 Outbreak,"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely spread worldwide. Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusively, this study suggests that pangolin species are a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs.","['1 State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University, No. 2 North Cuihu Road, Kunming, Yunnan 650091, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, School of Life Sciences, Yunnan University, No. 2 North Cuihu Road, Kunming, Yunnan 650091, China.

183,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Techniques for Brown Adipose Tissue Detection,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods can non-invasively assess brown adipose tissue (BAT) structure and function. Recently, MRI and MRS have been proposed as a means to differentiate BAT from white adipose tissue (WAT) and to extract morphological and functional information on BAT inaccessible by other means. Specifically, proton MR (1H) techniques, such as proton density fat fraction mapping, diffusion imaging, and intermolecular multiple quantum coherence imaging, have been employed to access BAT microstructure; MR thermometry, relaxometry, and MRI and MRS with 31P, 2H, 13C, and 129Xe have shown to provide complementary information on BAT function. The purpose of the present review is to provide a comprehensive overview of MR imaging and spectroscopy techniques used to detect BAT in rodents and in humans. The present work discusses common challenges of current methods and provides an outlook on possible future directions of using MRI and MRS in BAT studies.","['1 Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', '2 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.']","Mingming Wu, Daniela Junker, Rosa Tamara Branca, Dimitrios C Karampinos, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,activation; brown adipose tissue (BAT); magnetic resonance imaging; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; morphology; thermogenesis; white adipose tissue (WAT).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32849257
184,Emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses in pigs,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome-coronavirus (SADS-CoV) are emerging/reemerging coronaviruses (CoVs). They cause acute gastroenteritis in neonatal piglets. Sequence analyses suggest that PEDV and SADS-CoV may have originated from bat CoVs and PDCoV from a sparrow CoV, reaffirming the interspecies transmission of CoVs. The clinical signs and pathogenesis of the three viruses are similar. Necrosis of infected intestinal epithelial cells occurs, causing villous atrophy that results in malabsorptive diarrhea. The severe diarrhea and vomiting may lead to dehydration and death of piglets. Natural infection induces protective immunity, but there is no cross-protection among the three viruses. Besides strict biosecurity measures, individual vaccines are needed for each virus for disease prevention and control.","['1 Food Animal Health Research Program, Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, College of Food, Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH, USA.

185,Glucocorticoids and Brown Adipose Tissue: Do glucocorticoids really inhibit thermogenesis?,"A reduction in the thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is presently discussed as a possible determinant for the development of obesity in humans. One group of endogenous factors that could potentially affect BAT activity is the glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol). We analyse here studies examining the effects of alterations in glucocorticoid signaling on BAT recruitment and thermogenic capacity. We find that irrespective of which manipulation of glucocorticoid signaling is examined, a seemingly homogeneous picture of lowered thermogenic capacity due to glucocorticoid stimulation is apparently obtained: e.g. lowered uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein levels per mg protein, and an increased lipid accumulation in BAT. However, further analyses generally indicate that these effects result from a dilution effect rather than a true decrease in total capacity; the tissue may thus be said to be in a state of pseudo-atrophy. However, under conditions of very low physiological stimulation of BAT, glucocorticoids may truly inhibit Ucp1 gene expression and consequently lower total UCP1 protein levels, but the metabolic effects of this reduction are probably minor. It is thus unlikely that glucocorticoids affect organismal metabolism and induce the development of obesity through alterations of BAT activity.","['1 Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.', '2 Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.

186,Human Coronaviruses and Other Respiratory Viruses: Underestimated Opportunistic Pathogens of the Central Nervous System?,"Respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract, mostly causing mild diseases. However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.g., pneumonia). Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes. Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases. Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified. Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses.","['1 Laboratory of Neuroimmunovirology, Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS)-Institut Armand-Frappier, Université du Québec, Laval, QC H7V 1B7, Canada.', '2 Faculté de médecine et des sciences de la santé, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC J1K 2R1, Canada.', ""3 Research Centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.""]","Marc Desforges, Alain Le Coupanec, Philippe Dubeau, Andréanne Bourgouin, Louise Lajoie, Mathieu Dubé, Pierre J Talbot, ",Viruses,2019,CNS infection; acute and chronic neurological diseases; encephalitis; encephalopathy; human coronavirus; human respiratory virus; neuroinvasion; respiratory viral infection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31861926

This possible link and its implications can be investigated by observing the effects of modulation of the microbial flora in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of mortality, the need of ICU hospitalization and the length of hospitalization in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received the best available therapy (BAT) vs. patients treated with BAT and supplemented with oral bacteriotherapy. Methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study included 200 adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients received therapeutic regimens including low molecular weight heparin plus one or more between hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antivirals, and Tocilizumab. Oral bacteriotherapy was used as complementary treatment. Results: Out of the 200 patients, 112 received BAT without oral bacteriotherapy, and 88 BAT with oral bacteriotherapy. Crude mortality was 22%. Eleven percent died in the group of patients treated with BAT plus oral bacteriotherapy vs. 30% subjects in the group of patients managed only with BAT (p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, the age >65 years, CRP >41.8 mg/L, Platelets <150.000 mmc, and cardiovascular events were associated with the increased risk of mortality. Oral bacteriotherapy was an independent variable associated with a reduced risk for death.

189,The outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): A review of the current global status,"There is currently an ongoing worldwide pandemic of a novel virus belonging to the family of Coronaviruses (CoVs) which are large, enveloped, plus-stranded RNA viruses. Coronaviruses belong to the order of Nidovirales, family of Coronavirinae and are divided into four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus. CoVs cause diseases in a wide variety of birds and mammals and have been found in humans since 1960. To date, seven human CoVs were identified including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the novel virus that first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to 213 countries as of the writing this paper. It was ofﬁcially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) and the disease's name is COVID-19 for coronavirus disease 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious and is capable of spreading from human to human. Infection routes include droplet and contact, and aerosol transmission is currently under investigation. It is associated with a respiratory illness that may cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 became an emergency of international concern. As of July 12, 2020, the virus has been responsible for 12,698,995 confirmed cases and 564,924 deaths worldwide and the number is still increasing. Up until now, no specific treatment has yet been proven effective against SARS-CoV-2. Since the beginning of this outbreak, several interesting papers on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 have been published to report on the phylogenetic evolution, epidemiology, pathogenesis, transmission as well as clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and possible treatments agents. This paper is a systematic review of the available literature on SARS-CoV-2. It was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and aims to help readers access the latest knowledge surrounding this new infectious disease and to provide a reference for future studies.","['1 Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC), Département des sciences fondamentales, Centre intersectoriel en santé durable, Saguenay, Canada.', '2 Centre de recherche, Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Université Laval (IUCPQ-UL), Québec, Canada; Département de biochimie, de microbiologie et de bioinformatique, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.', '3 Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC), Département des sciences fondamentales, Centre intersectoriel en santé durable, Saguenay, Canada.

190,Bat Research Networks and Viral Surveillance: Gaps and Opportunities in Western Asia,"Bat research networks and viral surveillance are assumed to be at odds due to seemingly conflicting research priorities. Yet human threats that contribute to declines in bat populations globally also lead to increased transmission and spread of bat-associated viruses, which may pose a threat to global health and food security. In this review, we discuss the importance of and opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations between bat research networks and infectious disease experts to tackle shared threats that jeopardize bat conservation as well as human and animal health. Moreover, we assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses globally, and demonstrate that Western Asia has limited published research and represents a gap for coordinated bat research. The lack of bat research in Western Asia severely limits our capacity to identify and mitigate region-specific threats to bat populations and detect interactions between bats and incidental hosts that promote virus spillover. We detail a regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia (i.e., the Western Asia Bat Research Network, WAB-Net), with the aim of integrating ecological research on bats with virus surveillance to find ""win-win"" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region.","['1 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10001, USA. phelps@ecohealthalliance.org.', '2 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10001, USA. hamel@ecohealthalliance.org.', '3 Biosafety and Biosecurity Center, Royal Scientific Society, 11941 Amman, Jordan.

191,Basophil activation test for Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins in severe asthmatic patients,"Background:
        
      
      Several studies have shown an association between severe asthma and serum immunoglobulins E (IgE) against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SEs). SEs-the prototypes being types A (SEA), B (SEB) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1)-can induce both polyclonal and specific IgE responses. Objective:
        
      
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of SEs to induce basophil activation in severe asthmatic patients using the basophil activation test (BAT). Methods:
        
      
      57 severe asthmatic patients were enrolled. BAT in response to SEA, SEB and TSST-1 was performed in all patients, while serum IgE to SEA, SEB and SEC was available in 49 patients. BAT was considered positive when CD203c+ basophils to SEs were ≥5%, and the stimulation index (SI, ratio between % of CD203c+ basophils to SEs and to negative control) was >2. Two threshold values (>0.1 kU/L and >0.35 kU/L, respectively) were used to assess serum SEsIgE. Results:
        
      
      36.8% of severe asthmatic patients had a BAT positive for at least one SE (BAT SEs+). Serum SEsIgE >0.35 kU/L (SEs IgE+) was associated with BAT SEs positivity. Among patients with negative skin prick test, 35% were BAT SEs+, 30% SEs IgE+, 55% BAT or IgE- SEs+. A negative correlation between SI of BAT to SEs and both clinical (ACT score) and functional parameters was observed, together with a positive correlation of BAT with asthma exacerbations. Conclusions:
        
      
      The positivity of BAT for SEs in a subgroup of severe asthmatic patients further supports the pathogenic role of Staphylococcus aureus in severe asthma.","['1 Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', '2 Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', '3 Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', '4 Clinical Biochemistry Unit, A.O.R.N.

192,Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease,"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model. However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs. Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50 The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for CoV infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734) to include a group β-2a CoV. Further, GS-5734 potently inhibits CoVs with intact proofreading. Following selection with the GS-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across CoVs provide low-level resistance to GS-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of MHV in vitro and attenuate pathogenesis in a SARS-CoV animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of GS-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of MHV and SARS-CoV, supporting further development of GS-5734 as a potential effective pan-CoV antiviral.","['1 Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', '3 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', '4 Department of Biology, the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee, USA.', '5 Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, California, USA.', '6 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA rbaric@email.unc.edu mark.denison@vanderbilt.edu.', '7 Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA rbaric@email.unc.edu mark.denison@vanderbilt.edu.']","Maria L Agostini, Erica L Andres, Amy C Sims, Rachel L Graham, Timothy P Sheahan, Xiaotao Lu, Everett Clinton Smith, James Brett Case, Joy Y Feng, Robert Jordan, Adrian S Ray, Tomas Cihlar, Dustin Siegel, Richard L Mackman, Michael O Clarke, Ralph S Baric, Mark R Denison, ",mBio,2018,RNA polymerases; SARS-CoV; antiviral agents; antiviral resistance; coronavirus; nucleoside analogs; pandemic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29511076
193,Unbiased Screens Show CD8 + T Cells of COVID-19 Patients Recognize Shared Epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that Largely Reside outside the Spike Protein,"Developing effective strategies to prevent or treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires understanding the natural immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used an unbiased, genome-wide screening technology to determine the precise peptide sequences in SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by the memory CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 patients. In total, we identified 3-8 epitopes for each of the 6 most prevalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. These epitopes were broadly shared across patients and located in regions of the virus that are not subject to mutational variation. Notably, only 3 of the 29 shared epitopes were located in the spike protein, whereas most epitopes were located in ORF1ab or the nucleocapsid protein. We also found that CD8+ T cells generally do not cross-react with epitopes in the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold. Overall, these findings can inform development of next-generation vaccines that better recapitulate natural CD8+ T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","['1 TScan Therapeutics, Waltham, MA 02451, USA.', '2 Ochsner Medical Center, New Orleans, LA 70121, USA.', '3 Atlantic Health System, Morristown, NJ 07960, USA.', '4 TScan Therapeutics, Waltham, MA 02451, USA.

194,Overview of Immune Response During SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Lessons From the Past,"After the 1918 flu pandemic, the world is again facing a similar situation. However, the advancement in medical science has made it possible to identify that the novel infectious agent is from the coronavirus family. Rapid genome sequencing by various groups helped in identifying the structure and function of the virus, its immunogenicity in diverse populations, and potential preventive measures. Coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lymphopenia in infected individuals. Viral components like spike and nucleocapsid proteins trigger an immune response in the host to eliminate the virus. These viral antigens can be either recognized by the B cells or presented by MHC complexes to the T cells, resulting in antibody production, increased cytokine secretion, and cytolytic activity in the acute phase of infection. Genetic polymorphism in MHC enables it to present some of the T cell epitopes very well over the other MHC alleles. The association of MHC alleles and its downregulated expression has been correlated with disease severity against influenza and coronaviruses. Studies have reported that infected individuals can, after recovery, induce strong protective responses by generating a memory T-cell pool against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These memory T cells were not persistent in the long term and, upon reactivation, caused local damage due to cross-reactivity. So far, the reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2, which is highly contagious, shows related symptoms in three different stages and develops an exhaustive T-cell pool at higher loads of viral infection. As there are no specific treatments available for this novel coronavirus, numerous small molecular drugs that are being used for the treatment of diseases like SARS, MERS, HIV, ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis are being given to COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials for many such drugs have already begun. A classical immunotherapy of convalescent plasma transfusion from recovered patients has also been initiated for the neutralization of viremia in terminally ill COVID-19 patients. Due to the limitations of plasma transfusion, researchers are now focusing on developing neutralizing antibodies against virus particles along with immuno-modulation of cytokines like IL-6, Type I interferons (IFNs), and TNF-α that could help in combating the infection. This review highlights the similarities of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS to the novel SARS-CoV-2 in relation to their pathogenicity and immunogenicity and also focuses on various treatment strategies that could be employed for curing COVID-19.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences, BITS Pilani, K.

195,Genome-Scale Identification of SARS-CoV-2 and Pan-coronavirus Host Factor Networks,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed the lives of over one million people worldwide. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus life cycles remain ill defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VMP1, TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses. This human coronavirus host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus pandemics.","['1 Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', '2 Cancer Biology and Genetics, MSKCC, New York, NY 10065, USA.', '3 Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY 10016, USA.', '4 Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', '5 Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Among them, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the most recently discovered. It has created a severe worldwide outbreak beginning in late 2019, leading to date to over 4 million cases globally. Viruses are genetically simple, yet highly diverse. However, the recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, indicate that there remains a long way to go to identify and develop specific therapeutic treatments. Only after gaining a better understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms can we minimize viral pandemics. This paper mainly focuses on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Here, recent studies are summarized and reviewed, with a focus on virus-host interactions, vaccine-based and drug-targeted therapies, and the development of new approaches for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","['1 Division of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', '3 Department of Emergency Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.', '4 Department of Emergency Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China. zhangs@wchscu.cn.', '5 Kappa Crystals Ltd., Dublin, Ireland.

197,Systemic and mucosal antibody responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 during mild versus severe COVID-19,"Background:
        
      
      Whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody tests are increasingly being used to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the determinants of these antibody responses remain unclear. Objectives:
        
      
      Our aim was to evaluate systemic and mucosal antibody responses toward SARS-CoV-2 in mild versus severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Methods:
        
      
      Using immunoassays specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG in sera and mucosal fluids of 2 cohorts, including SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients (n = 64) and PCR-positive and PCR-negtive health care workers (n = 109). Results:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in patients with mild COVID-19 were often transiently positive, whereas serum IgG titers remained negative or became positive 12 to 14 days after symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers after symptom onset. Very high titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA were correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Interestingly, some health care workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibody titers showed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA in mucosal fluids with virus-neutralizing capacity in some cases. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA titers in nasal fluids were inversely correlated with age. Conclusions:
        
      
      Systemic antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in patients with severe COVID-19, with very high IgA titers seen in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient production of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but may stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion.","['1 Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '3 Institute of Virology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '4 Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '5 Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '6 Clinic for Internal Medicine, Uster Hospital, Uster, Switzerland.', '7 Department of Medicine, Limmattal Hospital, Schlieren, Switzerland.', '8 Clinic for Internal Medicine, City Hospital Triemli Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '9 Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '10 Institute of Virology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '11 Department of Biostatistics, at Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '12 Department of Immunology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

198,"In vitro virucidal activity of Echinaforce®, an Echinacea purpurea preparation, against coronaviruses, including common cold coronavirus 229E and SARS-CoV-2","Background:
        
      
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) were long thought to only cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms in humans but outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 have cemented their zoonotic potential and their capacity to cause serious morbidity and mortality, with case fatality rates ranging from 4 to 35%. Currently, no specific prophylaxis or treatment is available for CoV infections. Therefore we investigated the virucidal and antiviral potential of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce®) against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, highly pathogenic MERS- and SARS-CoVs, as well as the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, in vitro. Methods:
        
      
      To evaluate the antiviral potential of the extract, we pre-treated virus particles and cells and evaluated remaining infectivity by limited dilution. Furthermore, we exposed cells to the extract after infection to further evaluate its potential as a prophylaxis and treatment against coronaviruses. We also determined the protective effect of Echinaforce® in re-constituted nasal epithelium. Results:
        
      
      In the current study, we found that HCoV-229E was irreversibly inactivated when exposed to Echinaforce® at 3.2 μg/ml IC50. Pre-treatment of cell lines, however, did not inhibit infection with HCoV-229E and post-infection treatment had only a marginal effect on virus propagation at 50 μg/ml. However, we did observe a protective effect in an organotypic respiratory cell culture system by exposing pre-treated respiratory epithelium to droplets of HCoV-229E, imitating a natural infection. The observed virucidal activity of Echinaforce® was not restricted to common cold coronaviruses, as both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoVs were inactivated at comparable concentrations. Finally, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was also inactivated upon treatment with 50μg/ml Echinaforce®. Conclusions:
        
      
      These results show that Echinaforce® is virucidal against HCoV-229E, upon direct contact and in an organotypic cell culture model. Furthermore, MERS-CoV and both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were inactivated at similar concentrations of the extract. Therefore we hypothesize that Echinacea purpurea preparations, such as Echinaforce®, could be effective as prophylactic treatment for all CoVs due to their structural similarities.","['1 SPIEZ LABORATORY, Austrasse, 3700, Spiez, Switzerland.', '2 SPIEZ LABORATORY, Austrasse, 3700, Spiez, Switzerland. hulda-run.jonsdottir@babs.admin.ch.', '3 Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', '4 A.Vogel AG, Roggwil, Switzerland.', '5 SPIEZ LABORATORY, Austrasse, 3700, Spiez, Switzerland. olivier.engler@babs.admin.ch.']","Johanna Signer, Hulda R Jonsdottir, Werner C Albrich, Marc Strasser, Roland Züst, Sarah Ryter, Rahel Ackermann-Gäumann, Nicole Lenz, Denise Siegrist, Andreas Suter, Roland Schoop, Olivier B Engler, ",Virology journal,2020,Antivirals; Common cold; Coronavirus; Echinacea; HCoV-229E; MERS-CoV; Prevention; SARS-CoV-1; SARS-CoV-2.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32907596
199,Unexpected Functional Divergence of Bat Influenza Virus NS1 Proteins,"Recently, two influenza A virus (FLUAV) genomes were identified in Central and South American bats. These sequences exhibit notable divergence from classical FLUAV counterparts, and functionally, bat FLUAV glycoproteins lack canonical receptor binding and destroying activity. Nevertheless, other features that distinguish these viruses from classical FLUAVs have yet to be explored. Here, we studied the viral nonstructural protein NS1, a virulence factor that modulates host signaling to promote efficient propagation. Like all FLUAV NS1 proteins, bat FLUAV NS1s bind double-stranded RNA and act as interferon antagonists. Unexpectedly, we found that bat FLUAV NS1s are unique in being unable to bind host p85β, a regulatory subunit of the cellular metabolism-regulating enzyme, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Furthermore, neither bat FLUAV NS1 alone nor infection with a chimeric bat FLUAV efficiently activates Akt, a PI3K effector. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed that the bat FLUAV NS1-p85β interaction can be reengineered (in a strain-specific manner) by changing two to four NS1 residues (96L, 99M, 100I, and 145T), thereby creating a hydrophobic patch. Notably, ameliorated p85β-binding is insufficient for bat FLUAV NS1 to activate PI3K, and a chimeric bat FLUAV expressing NS1 with engineered hydrophobic patch mutations exhibits cell-type-dependent, but species-independent, propagation phenotypes. We hypothesize that bat FLUAV hijacking of PI3K in the natural bat host has been selected against, perhaps because genes in this metabolic pathway were differentially shaped by evolution to suit the unique energy use strategies of this flying mammal. These data expand our understanding of the enigmatic functional divergence between bat FLUAVs and classical mammalian and avian FLUAVs.IMPORTANCE The potential for novel influenza A viruses to establish infections in humans from animals is a source of continuous concern due to possible severe outbreaks or pandemics. The recent discovery of influenza A-like viruses in bats has raised questions over whether these entities could be a threat to humans. Understanding unique properties of the newly described bat influenza A-like viruses, such as their mechanisms to infect cells or how they manipulate host functions, is critical to assess their likelihood of causing disease. Here, we characterized the bat influenza A-like virus NS1 protein, a key virulence factor, and found unexpected functional divergence of this protein from counterparts in other influenza A viruses. Our study dissects the molecular changes required by bat influenza A-like virus NS1 to adopt classical influenza A virus properties and suggests consequences of bat influenza A-like virus infection, potential future evolutionary trajectories, and intriguing virus-host biology in bat species.","['1 Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '2 Institute of Virology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '3 Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', '4 Virology-CIET (Research Center for Tropical Diseases), Microbiology, University of Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica.', '5 Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland hale.ben@virology.uzh.ch.']","Hannah L Turkington, Mindaugas Juozapaitis, Nikos Tsolakos, Eugenia Corrales-Aguilar, Martin Schwemmle, Benjamin G Hale, ",Journal of virology,2018,AKT signaling; RNA virus; bats; influenza; virulence factors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29237829
200,"Bats, Bat Flies, and Fungi: A Case of Hyperparasitism","Bats are parasitized by numerous lineages of arthropods, of which bat flies (Diptera, Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) are the most conspicuous. Bat flies themselves can be parasitized by Laboulbeniales, fungal biotrophs of arthropods. This is known as hyperparasitism, a severely understudied phenomenon. Three genera of Laboulbeniales occur on bat flies: Arthrorhynchus on Nycteribiidae, Gloeandromyces and Nycteromyces on Streblidae. In this review we introduce the parasitic partners in this tripartite system and discuss their diversity, ecology, and specificity patterns, alongside some important life history traits. Furthermore, we cover recent advances in the study of the associations between bat flies and Laboulbeniales, which were neglected for decades. Among the most immediate needs for further studies are detailed tripartite field surveys.

201,Thermotogales origin scenario of eukaryogenesis,"How eukaryotes were generated is an enigma of evolutionary biology. Widely accepted archaeal-origin eukaryogenesis scenarios, based on similarities of genes and related characteristics between archaea and eukaryotes, cannot explain several eukaryote-specific features of the last eukaryotic common ancestor, such as glycerol-3-phosphate-type membrane lipids, large cells and genomes, and endomembrane formation. Thermotogales spheroids, having multicopy-integrated large nucleoids and producing progeny in periplasm, may explain all of these features as well as endoplasmic reticulum-type signal cleavage sites, although they cannot divide. We hypothesize that the progeny chromosome is formed by random joining small DNAs in immature progeny, followed by reorganization by mechanisms including homologous recombination enabled with multicopy-integrated large genome (MILG). We propose that Thermotogales ancestor spheroids came to divide owing to the archaeal cell division genes horizontally transferred via virus-related particles, forming the first eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA). Referring to the hypothesis, the archaeal information-processing system would have been established in FECA by random joining DNAs excised from the MILG, which contained horizontally transferred archaeal and bacterial DNAs, followed by reorganization by the MILG-enabled homologous recombination. Thus, the large genome may have been a prerequisite, but not a consequence, of eukaryogenesis. The random joining of DNAs likely provided the basic mechanisms for eukaryotic evolution: producing the diversity by the formations of supergroups, novel genes, and introns that are involved in exon shuffling.","['1 Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305‒8572, Ibaraki, Japan.

202,The evolution of high-fidelity social learning,"A defining feature of human culture is that knowledge and technology continually improve over time. Such cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) probably depends far more heavily on how reliably information is preserved than on how efficiently it is refined. Therefore, one possible reason that CCE appears diminished or absent in other species is that it requires accurate but specialized forms of social learning at which humans are uniquely adept. Here, we develop a Bayesian model to contrast the evolution of high-fidelity social learning, which supports CCE, against low-fidelity social learning, which does not. We find that high-fidelity transmission evolves when (1) social and (2) individual learning are inexpensive, (3) traits are complex, (4) individual learning is abundant, (5) adaptive problems are difficult and (6) behaviour is flexible. Low-fidelity transmission differs in many respects. It not only evolves when (2) individual learning is costly and (4) infrequent but also proves more robust when (3) traits are simple and (5) adaptive problems are easy. If conditions favouring the evolution of high-fidelity transmission are stricter (3 and 5) or harder to meet (2 and 4), this could explain why social learning is common, but CCE is rare.","['1 Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.', '2 School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']","Marcel Montrey, Thomas R Shultz, ",Proceedings.

203,Inclusive fitness and the major transitions in evolution,"Inclusive fitness theory is the leading framework for explaining the major transitions in evolution, whereby free-living subunits (e.g. cells, organisms) have cooperated to form new, higher-level units (e.g. organisms, eusocial societies). The theory has attracted considerable controversy. From a brief survey of the controversy's present status, I conclude that inclusive fitness theory continues to provide both a concept and a principled modelling tool of value for understanding social evolution, including major transitions. Turning to new developments in the study of major transitions, I describe work defining the point of occurrence of major transitions and, from inclusive fitness theory, the required conditions. I also suggest that it remains important to understand the evolution of individuality that occurs beyond such thresholds.","['1 School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, Norfolk NR4 7TJ, UK.

204,A timeless biology,"Contrary to claims that physics is timeless while biology is time-dependent, we take the opposite standpoint: physical systems' dynamics are constrained by the arrow of time, while living assemblies are time-independent. Indeed, the concepts of ""constraints"" and ""displacements"" shed new light on the role of continuous time flow in life evolution, allowing us to sketch a physical gauge theory for biological systems in long timescales. In the very short timescales of biological systems' individual lives, time looks like ""frozen"" and ""fixed"", so that the second law of thermodynamics is momentarily wrecked. The global symmetries (standing for biological constrained trajectories, i.e. the energetic gradient flows dictated by the second law of thermodynamics in long timescales) are broken by local ""displacements"" where time is held constant, i.e., modifications occurring in living systems. Such displacements stand for brief local forces, able to temporarily ""break"" the cosmic increase in entropy. The force able to restore the symmetries (called ""gauge field"") stands for the very long timescales of biological evolution. Therefore, at the very low speeds of life evolution, time is no longer one of the four phase space coordinates of a spacetime Universe: it becomes just a gauge field superimposed to three-dimensional biological systems. We discuss the implications in biology: when assessing living beings, the underrated role of isolated ""spatial"" modifications needs to be emphasized, living apart the evolutionary role of time.","['1 Center for Nonlinear Science, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203, USA.

By means of mitochondrial uncoupling activity BAT's main function is to produce heat instead of storing energy such as in white adipose tissue (WAT). Therefore, BAT is considered a new potential target to treat obesity and the metabolic syndrome. However, the contribution of this thermogenic tissue is still a matter of debate among researchers. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the differences between classical brown adipocytes and inducible beige adipocytes in humans, and the potential activators of BAT in humans. Furthermore newly described genetic markers for identification of these two types of brown adipocytes are examined. Finally, the potential of the current measurement techniques, and the contribution of BAT activity to whole body energy expenditure are discussed.","['1 NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism, Departments of Nutrition and Human Movement Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.', '2 NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism, Departments of Nutrition and Human Movement Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.

Additionally, the discovery of these novel viruses that are considered as insect-specific viruses (ISVs) has gained increasing attention in their potential use as biological agents. As example, we show how the ISV Nhumirim virus was used to reduce West Nile virus transmission when co-infecting the mosquito vector. We also discuss new translational opportunities of using ISVs to limit insect vector competence by using them to interfere with pathogen acquisition, to directly target the insect vector or to confer pathogen resistance by the insect vector.","['1 Department of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, USA.', '2 Department of Plant Pathology, University of California-Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '3 Department of Plant Pathology, University of California-Davis, CA 95616, USA.

      The purpose of our study was to determine the role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in cancer progression. Materials and methods:
        
      
      Our study was approved by our institutional review board and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant. Our study group comprised 132 cancer patients (116 f, 16 m; mean age 50 ± 16 years) who underwent F18-FDG PET/CT per standard clinical protocol, for staging or surveillance of cancer. We included patients who were BAT-positive on PET/CT and had clinical follow-up data available for at least 12 months or until tumor recurrence or tumor-related death, whichever occurred first. BAT volume by PET/CT was quantified by PET-CT Viewer shareware. Clinical information including tumor type, tumor recurrence, survival, and outside temperature at time of scan were recorded. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine longitudinal associations between BAT volume and tumor recurrence/mortality. Results:
        
      
      There were 55 tumor recurrences/tumor-related deaths over a median follow-up period of 71 (33; 110 interquartile range) months. Higher BAT volume was associated with an increased likelihood of tumor recurrence/tumor-associated mortality after adjustment for covariates (p = 0.03). Conclusion:
        
      
      BAT volume, assessed using routine PET/CT, is a predictor of tumor recurrence/mortality in patients with cancer, independent of other factors that can influence BAT activity, such as sex, age, BMI, or tumor type.","['1 Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging and Intervention, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Yawkey 6E, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.', '2 Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '3 Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1468 Madison Ave, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', '4 Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging and Intervention, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Yawkey 6E, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. mbredella@mgh.harvard.edu.']","Katrina Chu, Stijn A Bos, Corey M Gill, Martin Torriani, Miriam A Bredella, ",Skeletal radiology,NO_DATE,Body composition; Brown adipose tissue (BAT); FDG PET/CT; Survival; Tumor recurrence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31650208
210,The Potential Intermediate Hosts for SARS-CoV-2,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic since the first report in Wuhan. COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease and the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be bats. However, the intermediate host explaining the transmission and evolvement is still unclear. In addition to the wildlife which has access to contact with bats in the natural ecological environment and then infects humans in wildlife market, domestic animals are also able to establish themselves as the intermediate host after infected by SARS-CoV-2. Although recent studies related to SARS-CoV-2 have made a lot of progress, many critical issues are still unaddressed. Here, we reviewed findings regarding the investigations of the intermediate host, which may inspire future investigators and provide them with plenty of information. The results demonstrate the critical role of the intermediate host in the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2, and the efficient intervention on this basis may be useful to prevent further deterioration of COVID-19.","['1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']","Jie Zhao, Wei Cui, Bao-Ping Tian, ",Frontiers in microbiology,2020,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; intermediate host; review; transmission.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33101254
211,Should we expect neurological symptoms in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic?,"Introduction:
        
      
      There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development:
        
      
      Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion:
        
      
      Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms.

212,Flow virometry as a tool to study viruses,"In the last few decades, flow cytometry has redefined the field of biology, exponentially enhancing our understanding of cells, immunology, and microbiology. Flow cytometry recently gave birth to flow virometry, a new way to detect, analyze, and characterize single viral particles. Detection of viruses by flow cytometry is possible due to improvements in current flow cytometers, calibration, and tuning methods. We summarize the recent birth and novel uses of flow virometry and the progressive evolution of this tool to advance the field of virology. We also discuss the various flow virometry methods used to identify and analyze viruses. We briefly summarize other applications of flow virometry, including: virus detection, quantification, population discrimination, and viral particles' antigenic properties. Finally, we summarize how viral sorting will allow further progress of flow virometry to relate viral surface characteristics to infectivity properties.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', '2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.

213,Innervation of supraclavicular adipose tissue: A human cadaveric study,"Functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) was identified in adult humans only in 2007 with the use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging. Previous studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between obesity and BAT presence in humans. It is proposed that BAT possesses the capacity to increase metabolism and aid weight loss. In rodents it is well established that BAT is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system with the interscapular BAT being innervated via branches of intercostal nerves. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that BAT possesses beta-3 adrenoceptors, no studies have identified the specific nerve branch that carries sympathetic innervation to BAT in humans. The aim of this study was to identify and trace the peripheral nerve or nerves that innervate human BAT in the supraclavicular region. The posterior triangle region of the neck of cadaveric specimens were dissected in order to identify any peripheral nerve branches piercing and/or terminating in supraclavicular BAT. A previously undescribed branch of the cervical plexus terminating in a supraclavicular adipose depot was identified in all specimens. This was typically an independent branch of the plexus, from the third cervical spinal nerve, but in one specimen was a branch of the supraclavicular nerve. Histological analysis revealed the supraclavicular adipose depot contained tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive structures, which likely represent sympathetic axons. This is the first study that identifies a nerve branch to supraclavicular BAT-like tissue. This finding opens new avenues for the investigation of neural regulation of fat metabolism in humans.","['1 Department of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.', '2 Department of Physiology, School of Biomedical Sciences University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', '3 Department of Physiology Anatomy and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']","Will Sievers, Joseph A Rathner, Rodney A Green, Christine Kettle, Helen R Irving, Donna R Whelan, Richard G D Fernandez, Anita Zacharias, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702004

We recently reported a laboratory protocol for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays using two primer sets, N and N2. On January 30-31, 2020, the protocol and the reagents for these assays were distributed to the local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan nationwide, and thereafter SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was initiated. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LM S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for the SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, as both the assays showed consistent results for the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of E gene in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target specifically the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Therefore, the N2 set exhibits high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These results indicate that the protocol using the N and N2 sets is comparable to the commercially available kits, and thus is reliable for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.","['1 Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Murayama Branch, Japan.', '2 Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Murayama Branch, Japan.', '3 Influenza Virus Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Murayama Branch, Japan.', '4 Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan.']","Kiyoko Okamaoto, Kazuya Shirato, Naganori Nao, Shinji Saito, Tsutomu Kageyama, Hideki Hasegawa, Tadaki Suzuki, Shutoku Matsuyama, Makoto Takeda, ",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,2020,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; real-time RT-PCR.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32350226

216,Memory in Trait Macroevolution,"The history of a trait within a lineage may influence its future evolutionary trajectory, but macroevolutionary theory of this process is not well developed. For example, consider the simplified binary trait of living in cave versus surface habitat. The longer a species has been cave dwelling, the more accumulated loss of vision, pigmentation, and defense may restrict future adaptation if the species encounters the surface environment. However, the Markov model of discrete trait evolution that is widely adopted in phylogenetics does not allow the rate of cave-to-surface transition to decrease with longer duration as a cave dweller. Here we describe three models of evolution that remove this memoryless constraint, using a renewal process to generalize beyond the typical Poisson process of discrete trait macroevolution. We then show how the two-state renewal process can be used for inference, and we investigate the potential of phylogenetic comparative data to reveal different influences of trait duration, or memory in trait evolution. We hope that such approaches may open new avenues for modeling trait evolution and for broad comparative tests of hypotheses that some traits become entrenched.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Emma E Goldberg, Jasmine Foo, ",The American naturalist,NO_DATE,comparative methods; phylogenetics; renewal process; trait evolution.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32017618

220,The Kinetics of Swinging a Baseball Bat,"The purpose of this study was to compute the 3-dimensional kinetics required to swing 3 youth baseball bats of varying moments of inertia. The 306 swings by 22 male players (age 13-18 y) were analyzed. Inverse dynamics with respect to the batter's hands were computed given the known kinematics and physical properties of the bats. Peak force increased with larger bat moments of inertia and was strongly correlated with bat tip speed. By contrast, peak moments were weakly correlated with bat moments of inertia and bat tip speed. Throughout the swing, the force applied to the bat was dominated by a component aligned with the long axis of the bat and directed away from the bat knob, whereas the moment applied to the bat was minimal until just prior to ball impact. These results indicate that players act to mostly ""pull"" the bat during their swing until just prior to ball impact, at which point they rapidly increase the moment on the bat. This kinetic analysis provides novel insight into the forces and moments used to swing baseball bats.","['1 1 The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.', ""2 2 Queen's University.""]","Joseph J Crisco, Nikolas J Osvalds, Michael J Rainbow, ",Journal of applied biomechanics,2018,batting; force; moment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29651903

The blue whale with a maximum recorded length of 29.9 m for 173 t of weight is the largest animal known to have ever existed, and any dolphin's brain is most powerful and complex than any other brain in the animal kingdom, second only to primate's. Nevertheless, Cetacea are mammals that re-entered the oceans only a little over 50 million years ago, a relatively short time on the evolutionary scale. During this time cetaceans and humans have developed marked morphological and behavioral differences, yet their genomes show a high level of similarity. This present review is focused on the description and significance of newly accessible cetacean genome tools and information, and their relevance in the study of the evolution of successful phenotypic adaptations associated to mammal's marine existence, and their applicability to the unresolved disease mechanisms in humans.","['1 University of Ferrara, Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Ferrara 44121, Italy.

A number of RNA viruses recruit RHA to the viral RNA to facilitate virus replication. DNA viruses contain a DNA genome and replicate using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. RHA has also been reported to associate with some DNA viruses during replication, in which the enzyme acts on the viral RNA or protein products. As shown for Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, RHA has potential to allow the virus to control a switch in cellular gene expression to modulate the antiviral response. While the study of the interaction of RHA with DNA viruses is still at an early stage, preliminary evidence indicates that the underlying molecular mechanisms are diverse. We now review the current status of this emerging field.","['1 Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi province, PR China.', '2 Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Shanxi University, 92 Wucheng Road, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi province, PR China.

It does not only bear biological interest, but it is also associated with cultural, psychological, social and even philosophical issues. It is therefore to be expected that a great deal of research is being performed in order to study the evolution of ageing and, more specifically, the evolution of human ageing.

Evidence from a variety of sources shows that the human lifespan is increasing, and may well continue to increase to levels that are difficult to predict. In addition, the most important theories about ageing based on evolutionary principles will be examined. Examples are mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy and the disposable soma theory.

In dromedary camels, the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals. Differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals, as well as between humans and dromedary camels, highlight the role of host factors in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. One of these host factors, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), may be a critical determinant because it is variably expressed in MERS-CoV-susceptible species as well as in humans. This could partially explain inter- and intraspecies differences in the tropism, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of MERS-CoV. In this review, we explore the role of DPP4 and other host factors in MERS-CoV transmission and pathogenesis-such as sialic acids, host proteases, and interferons.

233,Of Mice and Men: The Coronavirus MHV and Mouse Models as a Translational Approach to Understand SARS-CoV-2,"The fatal acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, infection and mortality rates have been rising steadily worldwide. The lack of a vaccine, as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies, emphasize the need to develop new strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis. Since mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 share a common genus, lessons learnt from MHV and SARS-CoV could offer mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a comprehensive review of MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, thereby highlighting further translational avenues in the development of innovative strategies in controlling the detrimental course of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we have focused on various aspects, including host species, organotropism, transmission, clinical disease, pathogenesis, control and therapy, MHV as a model for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as mouse models for infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans share various similarities, there are also differences that need to be addressed when studying murine models. Translational approaches, such as humanized mouse models are pivotal in studying the clinical course and pathology observed in COVID-19 patients.

235,The SARS-CoV-2 conserved macrodomain is a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-like-CoVs encode 3 tandem macrodomains within non-structural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low μM affinities. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity. Importance:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 900 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","['The SARS-CoV-2 Conserved Macrodomain Is a Mono-ADP-Ribosylhydrolase.\n      \n    \n\nAlhammad YMO, Kashipathy MM, Roy A, Gagné JP, McDonald P, Gao P, Nonfoux L, Battaile KP, Johnson DK, Holmstrom ED, Poirier GG, Lovell S, Fehr AR.\nAlhammad YMO, et al.\nJ Virol. 2021 Jan 13;95(3):e01969-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01969-20.

236,"The genetics of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5 in Germany, 2006-2020","The H5 A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (gs/GD) lineage emerged in China in 1996. Rooted in the respective gs/GD lineage, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has genetically diversified into a plethora of clades and subclades and evolved into an assortment of sub- and genotypes. Some caused substantial losses in the poultry industry and had a major impact on wild bird populations alongside public health implications due to a zoonotic potential of certain clades. After the primary introduction of the HPAI H5N1 gs/GD lineage into Europe in autumn 2005 and winter 2005/2006, Germany has seen recurring incursions of four varying H5Nx subtypes (H5N1, H5N8, H5N5, H5N6) carrying multiple distinct reassortants, all descendants of the gs/GD virus. The first HPAIV H5 epidemic in Germany during 2006/2007 was caused by a clade 2.2 subtype H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed three distinct clusters belonging to clades 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2, concurring with geographic and temporal structures. From 2014 onwards, HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 has dominated the epidemiological situation in Germany. The initial clade 2.3.4.4a HPAIV H5N8, reaching Germany in November 2014, caused a limited epidemic affecting five poultry holdings, one zoo in Northern Germany and few wild birds. After November 2016, HPAIV of clade 2.3.4.4b have dominated the situation to date. The most extensive HPAIV H5 epidemic on record reached Germany in winter 2016/2017, encompassing multiple incursion events with two subtypes (H5N8, H5N5) and entailing five reassortants. A novel H5N6 clade 2.3.4.4b strain affected Germany from December 2017 onwards, instigating low-level infection in smallholdings and wild birds. Recently, in spring 2020, a novel incursion of a genetically distinct HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 virus caused another epidemic in Europe, which affected a small number of poultry holdings, one zoo and two wild birds throughout Germany.","['1 Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Insel Riems, Germany.', '2 Institute of Epidemiology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Insel Riems, Germany.']","Jacqueline King, Timm Harder, Franz J Conraths, Martin Beer, Anne Pohlmann, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,NO_DATE,Clade 2.2; Clade 2.3.4.4; HPAIV; highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses; reassortment; subtype H5.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32964686
237,"Allometry, evolution and development of neocortex size in mammals","Variation in neocortex size is one of the defining features of mammalian brain evolution. The paramount assumption has been that neocortex size indicates a monotonic allometric relationship with brain size. This assumption holds the concomitant neurodevelopmental assumption that the ontogenetic trajectory of neocortex size is so stable across species that it restrains changes in the direction of evolution. Here we test this fundamental assumption. Whereas previous research has focused exclusively on changes in mean size among groups (i.e., intercept), we additionally investigate changes in covariation (i.e., slope) and strength of allometric integration (i.e., residual variation). We further increase data resolution by investigating 350 species representing 11 mammalian orders. Results identify nine shifts in covariation between neocortex and brainstem in different mammalian groups, indicate that these shifts occur independently of shifts in size, and demonstrate that the strength of allometric integration across different neocortical regions in primates is inversely related to the neurodevelopmental gradient such that later developing regions underwent more evolutionary change. Although our results confirm that variation in brain organization is structured along a neurodevelopmental gradient, our results suggest two additional principles of size reorganization in brain evolution: (1) repatterning of growth allocation among brain regions may occur independently of size and (2) later developing regions indicate faster evolution, not necessarily directional evolution toward larger size. We conclude that the evolution of neocortex size in mammals is far more variable than previously assumed, in turn suggesting a higher degree of evolutionary flexibility in neurodevelopmental patterning than commonly suggested.","['1 Department of Anthropology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, United States.

238,Open-Endedness for the Sake of Open-Endedness,"Natural evolution keeps inventing new complex and intricate forms and behaviors. Digital evolution and genetic algorithms fail to create the same kind of complexity, not just because we still lack the computational resources to rival nature, but because (it has been argued) we have not understood in principle how to create open-ended evolving systems. Much effort has been made to define such open-endedness so as to create forms of increasing complexity indefinitely. Here, however, a simple evolving computational system that satisfies all such requirements is presented. Doing so reveals a shortcoming in the definitions for open-ended evolution. The goal to create models that rival biological complexity remains. This work suggests that our current definitions allow for even simple models to pass as open-ended, and that our definitions of complexity and diversity are more important for the quest of open-ended evolution than the fact that something runs indefinitely.","['1 Michigan State University, Department of Integrative Biology, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. hintze@msu.edu.']","Arend Hintze, ",Artificial life,NO_DATE,Open-ended evolution; complexity; computational model; diversity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31150291
239,Do estrogens enhance activation of brown and beiging of adipose tissues?,"Obesity and its associated co-morbidities are worldwide public health concerns. Obesity is characterized by excessive adipose tissue accumulation; however, it is important to recognize that human and rodent adipose tissues are made up of several distinct adipose tissue sub-types. White adipose tissue (WAT) is considered the prototypical fat cell, due to its capacity and capability to store large amounts of lipid. In contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) oxidizes substrates to generate heat. BAT contains more mitochondria than WAT and express uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which mediates BAT thermogenesis. A third sub-type of adipose tissue, Brown-in-white (BRITE)/beige adipocytes arise from WAT upon adrenergic stimulation and resembles BAT functionally. The energy burning feature of BAT/beige cells, combined with evidence of an inverse-correlation between BAT/beige adipose tissue and obesity have given rise to the hypothesis that obesity may be linked to BAT/beige 'malfunction'. Females have more BAT and perhaps an enhanced capacity to beige their adipose tissue when compared to males. Multiple signal pathways are capable of activating BAT thermogenesis and beiging of WAT; here, we discuss the potential role of estrogens in enhancing and mediating these factors to enhance adipose tissue thermogenesis.","['1 Biomedical Research Division, Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute, Department of Biomedical Science, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', '2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States.', '3 Biomedical Research Division, Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute, Department of Biomedical Science, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.

240,The Evolution of 'Ecological Release' into the 21st Century,"Ecological release, originally conceived as niche expansion following a reduction in interspecific competition, may prompt invasion success, morphological evolution, speciation, and other ecological and evolutionary outcomes. However, the concept has not been recently reviewed. Here, we trace the study of 'ecological release' from its inception through the present day and find that current definitions are broad and highly varied. Viewing this development as a potential impediment to clear communication and hypothesis testing, we suggest a consensus definition for ecological release: niche expansions and shifts when a constraining interspecific interaction is reduced or removed. In rationalizing this definition, we highlight the various ways ecological release can unfold and address its potential evolutionary consequences.","['1 Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

241,Multiple evolutionary origins of giant viruses,"The nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are a monophyletic group of diverse eukaryotic viruses that reproduce primarily in the cytoplasm of the infected cells and include the largest viruses currently known: the giant mimiviruses, pandoraviruses, and pithoviruses. With virions measuring up to 1.5 μm and genomes of up to 2.5 Mb, the giant viruses break the now-outdated definition of a virus and extend deep into the genome size range typical of bacteria and archaea. Additionally, giant viruses encode multiple proteins that are universal among cellular life forms, particularly components of the translation system, the signature cellular molecular machinery. These findings triggered hypotheses on the origin of giant viruses from cells, likely of an extinct fourth domain of cellular life, via reductive evolution. However, phylogenomic analyses reveal a different picture, namely multiple origins of giant viruses from smaller NCLDVs via acquisition of multiple genes from the eukaryotic hosts and bacteria, along with gene duplication. Thus, with regard to their origin, the giant viruses do not appear to qualitatively differ from the rest of the virosphere. However, the evolutionary forces that led to the emergence of virus gigantism remain enigmatic.","['1 National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']","Eugene V Koonin, Natalya Yutin, ",F1000Research,2018,gene gain; gene loss; giant viruses; phagocytosis; virus evolution; virus-host interaction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30542614
242,Food products as potential carriers of SARS-CoV-2,"At present, humanity is confronting with a novel life-threatening challenge from the COVID-19 pandemic infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. To date, the various transmission modes of SARS-CoV-2 have not been completely determined. Food products might be carriers for SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic not only can spread through the respiratory tract like SARS and MERS but also the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of several patients, shows the possibility of their fecal-oral route spread. Besides, people with gastric problems, including gastric intestinal metaplasia and atrophic gastritis, may be susceptible to this kind of COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, food may act as a potential vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 due to whether carry-through or carry-over contaminations. Considering carry-over, SARS-CoV-2 spread from personnel to food products or food surfaces is feasible. Beyond that, some shreds of evidence showed that pigs and rabbits can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, viral transmission through meat products may be conceivable, indicating carry-through contamination. As the spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 is high and its stability in different environments, especially food processing surfaces, is also remarkable, it may enter foods in whether industrialized processing or the traditional one. Therefore, established precautious acts is suggested to be applied in food processing units. The present review elucidates the risk of various staple food products, including meat and meat products, dairy products, bread, fruits, vegetables, and ready-to-eat foods as potential carriers for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Student Research Committee, Department of Food Science and Technology, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Faculty of Nutrition and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', '2 Food Safety Research Center, Department of Food Science and Technology, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Faculty of Nutrition Sciences and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']","Reza Yekta, Leily Vahid-Dastjerdi, Sahar Norouzbeigi, Amir M Mortazavian, ",Food control,NO_DATE,COVID-19; Food; Foodborne; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33199941
243,The Ecology and Evolution of Pangenomes,"Since the first genome-scale comparisons, it has been evident that the genomes of many species are unbound by strict vertical descent: Large differences in gene content can occur among genomes belonging to the same prokaryotic species, with only a fraction of genes being universal to all genomes. These insights gave rise to the pangenome concept. The pangenome is defined as the set of all the genes present in a given species and can be subdivided into the accessory genome, present in only some of the genomes, and the core genome, present in all the genomes. Pangenomes arise due to gene gain by genomes from other species through horizontal gene transfer and differential gene loss among genomes, and have been described in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Our current view of pangenome variation is phenomenological and incomplete. In this review, we outline the mechanistic, ecological and evolutionary drivers of and barriers to horizontal gene transfer that are likely to structure pangenomes. We highlight the key role of conflict between the host chromosome(s) and the mobile genetic elements that mediate gene exchange. We identify shortcomings in our current models of pangenome evolution and suggest directions for future research to allow a more complete understanding of how and why pangenomes evolve.","['1 Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK.

244,Argonaute-2 is associated to brown adipose tissue activation,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important modulators of thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT). They have been involved in its differentiation and hence its functioning. While different regulators of the miRNA machinery have been shown to be essential for BAT differentiation, little is known about their implication in BAT activation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of AGO2, the chief miRNA mediator, in BAT activation. We took advantage of two non-genetic models of BAT activation to analyze the miRNA machinery and miRNA expression in BAT. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain an overview of miRNA expression according to the BAT activation state. In vitro, we examined AGO2 expression during brown adipocyte differentiation and activation. Finally, we downregulated AGO2 to reveal its potential role in the thermogenic function of brown adipocytes. PCA analysis allowed to cluster animals on their miRNA signature in active BAT. Moreover, hierarchical clustering showed a positive correlation between global upregulation of miRNA expression and active BAT. Consistently, the miRNA machinery, particularly AGO2, was upregulated in vivo in active BAT and in vitro in mature brown adipocytes. Finally, the partial loss-of-function of AGO2 in mature brown adipocytes is sufficient to lead to a diminished expression of UCP1 associated to a decreased uncoupled respiration. Therefore, our study shows the potential contribution of AGO2 in BAT activation. Since BAT is a calorie-burning tissue these data have a translational potential in terms of therapeutic target in the field of altered fuel homeostasis associated to obesity and diabetes.","[""1 Université Côte d'Azur, Inserm, CNRS, IRCAN, France; Université Côte d'Azur, Inserm, C3M, France."", ""2 Université Côte d'Azur, Inserm, CNRS, IRCAN, France."", ""3 Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS, Inserm, iBV, France."", ""4 Université Côte d'Azur, Inserm, CNRS, IRCAN, France; Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS, Inserm, iBV, France."", ""5 Université Côte d'Azur, CHU, Inserm, CNRS, IRCAN, France; Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS, LP2M, France.

248,Long Non-Coding RNAs in Brown Adipose Tissue,"Obesity has become a widespread disease that is harmful to human health. Fat homeostasis is essentially maintained by fat accumulation and energy expenditure. Studies on brown adipose tissue (BAT) represent a promising opportunity to identify a pharmaceutical intervention against obesity through increased energy expenditure. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were thought to be critical regulators in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies have revealed that lncRNAs, including ones that are BAT-specific, conserved, and located at key protein-coding genes, function in brown adipogenesis, white adipose browning (ie, beige adipogenesis), and brown thermogenesis. In this review, we describe lncRNA properties and highlight functional lncRNAs in these biological processes, with the goal of establishing links between lncRNAs and BAT. Based on the advances of lncRNAs in the regulation of BAT, we discussed the advantages of potential lncRNA-based obesity drugs. Further BAT lncRNA-based drug development may provide new exciting approaches to defend obesity by regulation of fat homeostasis.","[""1 Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, People's Republic of China."", ""2 The Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, People's Republic of China.""]","Songjia Lai, Kun Du, Yu Shi, Cao Li, Guoze Wang, Shenqiang Hu, Xianbo Jia, Jie Wang, Shiyi Chen, ","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",2020,BAT; lncRNAs; obesity; thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32982350
249,Endotoxemia by Porphyromonas gingivalis Alters Endocrine Functions in Brown Adipose Tissue,"Improvement of obesity is important for increasing longevity. The characteristics, size, and function of adipocytes are altered in patients with obesity. Adipose tissue is not only an energy storage but also an endocrine organ. Alteration of endocrine activities in adipose tissue, among them the functional decline of brown adipose tissue (BAT), is associated with obesity. Periodontal disease is a risk factor for systemic diseases since endotoxemia is caused by periodontal bacteria. However, the effect of periodontal disease on obesity remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of endotoxemia due to Porphyromonas gingivalis, a prominent cause of periodontal disease, on the BAT. Herein, endotoxemia was induced in 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice through intravenous injection of sonicated 108 CFU of P. gingivalis (Pg) or saline (control [Co]) once. Eighteen hours later, despite no inflammatory M1 macrophage infiltration, inflammation-related genes were upregulated exclusively in the BAT of Pg mice compared with Co mice. Although no marked histological changes were observed in adipose tissues, expressions of genes related to lipolysis, Lipe and Pnpla2 were downregulated after P. gingivalis injection in BAT. Furthermore, expression of Pparg and Adipoq was downregulated only in the BAT but not in the white adipose tissues, along with downregulation of Ucp1 and Cidea expression, which are BAT-specific markers, in Pg mice. Microarray analysis of the BAT showed 106 differentially expressed genes between Co and Pg mice. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the cholesterol homeostasis gene set and PI3/Akt/mTOR signaling gene set in BAT were downregulated, whereas the TGF-β signaling gene set was enriched in Pg mice. Overall, intravenous injection of sonicated P. gingivalis altered the endocrine functions of the BAT in mice. This study indicates that endotoxemia by P. gingivalis potentially affects obesity by disrupting BAT function.","['1 Department of Periodontology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Oral Diagnosis and General Dentistry, Dental Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Division of Molecular Genetics, Research Center for Medical Sciences, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', '4 Dysphagia Rehabilitation, Department of Gerontology and Gerodontology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', '5 Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, Facility of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', '6 Liver Center, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.']","Masahiro Hatasa, Yujin Ohsugi, Sayaka Katagiri, Sumiko Yoshida, Hiromi Niimi, Kazuki Morita, Yosuke Tsuchiya, Tsuyoshi Shimohira, Naoki Sasaki, Shogo Maekawa, Takahiko Shiba, Tomomitsu Hirota, Haruka Tohara, Hirokazu Takahashi, Hiroshi Nitta, Takanori Iwata, ",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Porphyromonas gingivalis; brown adipose tissue; endotoxemia; obesity; periodontal disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33542905

Such a limited perspective on virus diversity has in part arisen because viruses were traditionally considered only as etiologic agents of overt disease in humans or economically important species and were often difficult to identify using cell culture. This view has dramatically changed with the rise of metagenomics, which is transforming virus discovery and revealing a remarkable diversity of viruses sampled from diverse cellular organisms. These newly discovered viruses help fill major gaps in the evolutionary history of viruses, revealing a near continuum of diversity among genera, families, and even orders of RNA viruses.

Yet, the multiple functions of individual traits are rarely explicitly considered in ecology and evolution due to a lack of a quantitative framework. We present a theory for considering the combined importance of the several functions that a single trait can contribute to alleviating multiple stresses. We derive five inter-related general predictions: (1) that trait multifunctionality is overall highly beneficial to fitness; (2) that species possessing multifunctional traits should increase in abundance and in niche breadth; (3) that traits are typically optimized for multiple functions and thus can be far from optimal for individual functions; (4) that the relative importance of each function of a multifunctional trait depends on the environment; and (5) that traits will be often ""co-opted"" for additional functions during evolution and community assembly. We demonstrate how the theory can be applied quantitatively by examining the multiple functions of leaf trichomes (hairs) using heuristic model simulations, substantiating the general principles.

258,"Comparative tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage profiling of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with implications for clinical manifestations, transmissibility, and laboratory studies of COVID-19: an observational study","Background:
        
      
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported from China in January, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus-host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown. Methods:
        
      
      We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV. We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA. For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student's t test. We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA. Findings:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0·52). By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0·0098). SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0·036). For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0·016; FRhK4, p=0·0004). Interpretation:
        
      
      As far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide novel insights into the lower incidence of diarrhoea, decreased disease severity, and reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19, with respect to the pathogenesis and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV.

259,The Evolutionary Origin of Associative Learning,"Learning is a widespread ability among animals and, like physical traits, is subject to evolution. But how did learning first arise? What selection pressures and phenotypic preconditions fostered its evolution? Neither the fossil record nor phylogenetic comparative studies provide answers to these questions. Here, we take a novel approach by studying digital organisms in environments that promote the evolution of navigation and associative learning. Starting with a nonlearning sessile ancestor, we evolve multiple populations in four different environments, each consisting of nutrient trails with various layouts. Trail nutrients cue organisms on which direction to follow, provided they evolve to acquire and use those cues. Thus, each organism is tested on how well it navigates a randomly selected trail before reproducing. We find that behavior evolves modularly and in a predictable sequence, where simpler behaviors are necessary precursors for more complex ones. Associative learning is only one of many successful behaviors to evolve, and its origin depends on the environment possessing certain information patterns that organisms can exploit. Environmental patterns that are stable across generations foster the evolution of reflexive behavior, while environmental patterns that vary across generations but remain consistent for periods within an organism's lifetime foster the evolution of learning behavior. Both types of environmental patterns are necessary, since the prior evolution of simple reflexive behaviors provides the building blocks for learning to arise. Finally, we observe that an intrinsic value system evolves alongside behavior and supports associative learning by providing reinforcement for behavior conditioning.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Anselmo C Pontes, Robert B Mobley, Charles Ofria, Christoph Adami, Fred C Dyer, ",The American naturalist,NO_DATE,artificial intelligence; associative learning; digital evolution; evolution of behavior; evolutionary transitions; origin of learning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868538
260,Genetics of human brain evolution,"During the course of evolution the human brain has increased in size and complexity, ultimately these differences are the result of changes at the genetic level. Identifying and characterizing molecular evolution requires an understanding of both the genetic underpinning of the system as well as the comparative genetic tools to identify signatures of selection. This chapter aims to describe our current understanding of the genetics of human brain evolution. Primarily this is the story of the evolution of the human brain since our last common ape ancestor, but where relevant we will also discuss changes that are unique to the primate brain (compared to other mammals) or various other lineages in the evolution of humans more generally. It will focus on genetic changes that both directly affected the development and function of the brain as well as those that have indirectly influenced brain evolution through both prenatal and postnatal environment. This review is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to begin to construct a general framework for understanding the full array of data being generated.","['1 University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, United States; Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA, United States.

262,COVID-19: from an acute to chronic disease? Potential long-term health consequences,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite pulmonary impairments being the most prevalent, extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have now surpassed 57.8 million worldwide as of 22 November 2020. With estimated case fatality rates (number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by number of confirmed COVID-19 cases) varying between 1 and 7%, there will be a large population of recovered COVID-19 patients that may acquire a multitude of long-term health consequences. While the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19 are now well-documented, the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. In this review, we turn to previous similar coronaviruses (i.e. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) in combination with known health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict potential long-term effects of COVID-19, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial manifestations, in addition to the well-known post-intensive care syndrome. It is necessary to monitor COVID-19 patients after discharge to understand the breadth and severity of long-term effects. This can be accomplished by repurposing or initiating large cohort studies to not only focus on the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also on acquired immune function as well as ethno-racial group and household income disparities in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The future for COVID-19 survivors remains uncertain, and if this virus circulates among us for years to come, long-term effects may accumulate exponentially.","['1 Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', '2 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada.', '3 Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', '4 Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']","Victoria Higgins, Dorsa Sohaei, Eleftherios P Diamandis, Ioannis Prassas, ",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,NO_DATE,COVID-19; Coronavirus; chronic effects; long-COVID; pandemic.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33347790
263,Viral Membrane Fusion and the Transmembrane Domain,"Initiation of host cell infection by an enveloped virus requires a viral-to-host cell membrane fusion event. This event is mediated by at least one viral transmembrane glycoprotein, termed the fusion protein, which is a key therapeutic target. Viral fusion proteins have been studied for decades, and numerous critical insights into their function have been elucidated. However, the transmembrane region remains one of the most poorly understood facets of these proteins. In the past ten years, the field has made significant advances in understanding the role of the membrane-spanning region of viral fusion proteins. We summarize developments made in the past decade that have contributed to the understanding of the transmembrane region of viral fusion proteins, highlighting not only their critical role in the membrane fusion process, but further demonstrating their involvement in several aspects of the viral lifecycle.","['1 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, 741 South Limestone Street, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']","Chelsea T Barrett, Rebecca Ellis Dutch, ",Viruses,2020,transmembrane domain; viral fusion protein.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32604992
264,Viral subversion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,"Viruses have evolved in tandem with the organisms that they infect. Afflictions of the plant and animal kingdoms with viral infections have forced the host organism to evolve new or exploit existing systems to develop the countermeasures needed to offset viral insults. As one example, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular quality-control mechanism ensuring the translational fidelity of mRNA transcripts, has been used to restrict virus replication in both plants and animals. In response, viruses have developed a slew of means to disrupt or become insensitive to NMD, providing researchers with potential new reagents that can be used to more fully understand the NMD mechanism.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.', '2 Center for RNA Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']","Maximilian Wei-Lin Popp, Hana Cho, Lynne E Maquat, ","RNA (New York, N.Y.)",NO_DATE,NMD; animal cells; coronavirus; host-virus interactions; plant cells.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32699064

Many DNA tumor viruses and retroviruses will reprogram metabolism during infection. Additionally, some viral oncogenes may alter metabolism independent of virus replication. Virus infection and cancer development share many similarities regarding metabolic reprogramming as both processes demand increased metabolic activity to produce biomass: cell proliferation in the case of cancer and virion production in the case of infection.

266,Niche Estimation Above and Below the Species Level,"Ecological niches reflect not only adaptation to local circumstances but also the tendency of related lineages to share environmental tolerances. As a result, information on phylogenetic relationships has underappreciated potential to inform ecological niche modeling. Here we review three strategies for incorporating evolutionary information into niche models: splitting lineages into subunits, lumping across lineages, and partial pooling of lineages into a common statistical framework that implicitly or explicitly accounts for evolutionary relationships. We challenge the default practice of modeling at the species level, which ignores the process of niche evolution and erroneously assumes that the species is always the appropriate level for niche estimation. Progress in the field requires reexamination of how we assess models of niches versus models of distributions.","['1 Center for Conservation and Center for Conservation and Sustainable Development, Missouri Botanical Garden, Saint Louis, MO 63116, USA.

267,Immune Ecosystem of Virus-Infected Host Tissues,"Virus infected host cells serve as a central immune ecological niche during viral infection and replication and stimulate the host immune response via molecular signaling. The viral infection and multiplication process involves complex intracellular molecular interactions between viral components and the host factors. Various types of host cells are also involved to modulate immune factors in delicate and dynamic equilibrium to maintain a balanced immune ecosystem in an infected host tissue. Antiviral host arsenals are equipped to combat or eliminate viral invasion. However, viruses have evolved with strategies to counter against antiviral immunity or hijack cellular machinery to survive inside host tissue for their multiplication. However, host immune systems have also evolved to neutralize the infection; which, in turn, either clears the virus from the infected host or causes immune-mediated host tissue injury. A complex relationship between viral pathogenesis and host antiviral defense could define the immune ecosystem of virus-infected host tissues. Understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying this ecosystem would uncover strategies to modulate host immune function for antiviral therapeutics. This review presents past and present updates of immune-ecological components of virus infected host tissue and explains how viruses subvert the host immune surveillances.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China. mohamed_maarof@im.ac.cn.', '2 CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing 100101, China. kulrajrai701@gmail.com.', '3 Key Laboratory of Fujian-Taiwan Animal Pathogen Biology, College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China. goraya_uaf@yahoo.com.', '4 Key Laboratory of Fujian-Taiwan Animal Pathogen Biology, College of Animal Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China. chenjl@im.ac.cn.']","Mohamed Maarouf, Kul Raj Rai, Mohsan Ullah Goraya, Ji-Long Chen, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2018,ecosystem; immune subversion; immunity; virus; virus pathogenesis; virus-host interaction.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29734779
268,Group selection in behavioral evolution,"How may patterns of behavior change over an organism's lifetime? The answer is that they evolve (behavioral evolution) as species evolve over generations (biological evolution). In biological evolution, under certain conditions, groups of cooperative organisms would be selected over groups of non-cooperative organisms, even when cooperation imposes a cost to individuals. Analogously, in behavioral evolution, patterns of acts may be selected even when each individual act in the pattern is costly. Although there is considerable debate among biologists whether the conditions for group selection are met in biological evolution, it is argued here that they are met in behavioral evolution (as well as in cultural evolution). The article shows how selection of patterns can explain the learning of self-control and altruism.","['1 Psychology Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-2500, United States.

Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals.","['1 Microbiology Department, Virology Division, College of Medicine, Taif University, Al-Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia.', '2 Virology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef 62511, Egypt.', '3 Institute of Molecular Virology and Cell Biology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, 17493 Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.']","Ahmed S Abdel-Moneim, Elsayed M Abdelwhab, ","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,COVID-19; Coronaviridae; SARS-CoV-2; animal modeling; bats; interspecies transmission; pandemic; pets; viral zoonosis; zoo animals.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32629960
271,Community coalescence: an eco-evolutionary perspective,"Community coalescence, the mixing of different communities, is widespread throughout microbial ecology. Coalescence can result in approximately equal contributions from the founding communities or dominance of one community over another. These different outcomes have ramifications for community structure and function in natural communities, and the use of microbial communities in biotechnology and medicine. However, we have little understanding of when a particular outcome might be expected. Here, we integrate existing theory and data to speculate on how a crucial characteristic of microbial communities-the type of species interaction that dominates the community-might affect the outcome of microbial community coalescence. Given the often comparable timescales of microbial ecology and microevolution, we explicitly consider ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and their interplay, in determining coalescence outcomes.

There is growing appreciation of the burden of noninfluenza viral pathogens in CAP. Due to multiple factors including pneumococcal vaccination programs, declining rates of cigarette smoking, an aging population, and increasingly sensitive diagnostic tests, respiratory viruses are now the most common pathogens detected in CAP, outpacing Streptococcus pneumoniae. Noninfluenza respiratory pathogens are widely accepted as causal pathogens in CAP including in immunocompetent patients. This review provides an overview of five noninfluenza respiratory viral pathogens commonly implicated in CAP pathogenesis: rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, and human adenoviruses.

273,Preliminary Identification of Potential Vaccine Targets for the COVID-19 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Based on SARS-CoV Immunological Studies,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.', '2 Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.']","Syed Faraz Ahmed, Ahmed A Quadeer, Matthew R McKay, ",Viruses,2020,2019 novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; B cell epitopes; COVID-19; Coronavirus; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; T cell epitopes; vaccine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32106567

275,The Evolution of Insect Metamorphosis,"The evolution of insect metamorphosis is one of the most important sagas in animal history, transforming small, obscure soil arthropods into a dominant terrestrial group that has profoundly shaped the evolution of terrestrial life. The evolution of flight initiated the trajectory towards metamorphosis, favoring enhanced differences between juvenile and adult stages. The initial step modified postembryonic development, resulting in the nymph-adult differences characteristic of hemimetabolous species. The second step was to complete metamorphosis, holometaboly, and occurred by profoundly altering embryogenesis to produce a larval stage, the nymph becoming the pupa to accommodate the deferred development needed to make the adult. These changing life history patterns were intimately linked to two hormonal systems, the ecdysteroids and the juvenile hormones (JH), which function in both embryonic and postembryonic domains and control the stage-specifying genes Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), broad and E93. The ecdysteroids induce and direct molting through the ecdysone receptor (EcR), a nuclear hormone receptor with numerous targets including a conserved transcription factor network, the 'Ashburner cascade', which translates features of the ecdysteroid peak into the different phases of the molt. With the evolution of metamorphosis, ecdysteroids acquired a metamorphic function that exploited the repressor capacity of the unliganded EcR, making it a hormone-controlled gateway for the tissue development preceding metamorphosis. JH directs ecdysteroid action, controlling Kr-h1 expression which in turn regulates the other stage-specifying genes. JH appears in basal insect groups as their embryos shift from growth and patterning to differentiation. As a major portion of embryogenesis was deferred to postembryonic life with the evolution of holometaboly, JH also acquired a potent role in regulating postembryonic growth and development. Details of its involvement in broad expression and E93 suppression have been modified as life cycles became more complex and likely underlie some of the changes seen in the shift from incomplete to complete metamorphosis.","['1 Department of Biology and Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington, 620 University Road, Friday Harbor, WA 98250, USA.

However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.","['1 Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', '2 J.

This was, in large part, due to the relative ease with which sufficient quantities of material could be produced for such analyses. As analytical techniques became increasingly sensitive, similar studies could be performed on the viruses from other organisms. However, plant viruses continued to play an important role in the development of molecular biology, including the demonstration that RNA can be infectious, the determination of the genetic code, the mechanism by which viral RNAs are translated, and some of the early studies on gene silencing. Thus, the study of plant viruses should not be considered a ""niche"" subject but rather part of the mainstream of virology and molecular biology.","['1 John Innes Centre, Norwich, United Kingdom.

Current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have fueled ongoing efforts to exploit various viral target proteins for therapy, but strategies aimed at blocking the viral proteins as in drug and vaccine development have largely failed. In fact, evidence has now shown that coronaviruses undergoes rapid recombination to generate new strains of altered virulence; additionally, escaped the host antiviral defense system and target humoral immune system which further results in severe deterioration of the body such as by cytokine storm. This demands the understanding of phenotypic and genotypic classification, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 for the production of potential therapy. In lack of clear clinical evidences for the pathogenesis of COVID-19, comparative analysis of previous pandemic HCoVs associated immunological responses can provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the possible origin and transmission mode of CoVs and the current understanding on the viral genome integrity of known pandemic virus against SARS-CoV-2. We also consider the host immune response and viral evasion based on available clinical evidences which would be helpful to remodel COVID-19 pathogenesis; and hence, development of therapeutics against broad spectrum of coronaviruses.","['1 Department of Science, Modern Institute of Technology, Dhalwala, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.', '2 Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Biotechnology, College of Life and Applied Sciences, Yeungnam University, 280 Daehak-Ro, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk 38541, Republic of Korea.

Mean age of patients with GBS was 61.54 years, with standard deviation (SD) 14.18 years. Majority patients had fever and cough as the first symptom of SARS COV-2 infection. Mean time for onset of neurological symptoms from initial symptoms in 11 patients was 8.18 days, with SD of 2.86 days. Mean time to performing electrodiagnostic study from onset of neurological symptom was 6 days with standard deviation of 3.25. Six patients had demyelinating pattern, three had acute sensory motor axonal neuropathy, and one had acute motor axonal neuropathy on electrodiagnostic studies.","['1 Department of Neurology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States.', '2 Department of Pulmonary- Critical Care Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital, New York, NY, United States.', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital, New York, NY, United States.']","Nakul Katyal, Naureen Narula, Sudeep Acharya, Raghav Govindarajan, ",Frontiers in neurology,2020,COVID 19; SARS-CoV-2; complications; neurology; neuromuscular; pathophysiology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33041989
281,Neurological complications of coronavirus and COVID-19,"Introduction:
        
      
      Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system. Seven types of coronavirus can infect humans. Development:
        
      
      Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus). Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions:
        
      
      Future epidemiological studies and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.","['1 Universitat Internacional de Catalunya, Barcelona, España.', '2 Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, Reino Unido.']","F J Carod-Artal, ",Revista de neurologia,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32329044
282,Diet-induced thermogenesis: fake friend or foe?,"Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) is energy dissipated as heat after a meal, contributing 5-15% to total daily energy expenditure (EE). There has been a long interest in the intriguing possibility that a defect in DIT predisposes to obesity. However, the evidence is conflicting; DIT is usually quantified by indirect calorimetry, which does not measure heat. Using gas exchange, indirect calorimetry measures total post-prandial EE, which comprises heat energy produced from brown adipose tissue (BAT) and energy required for processing and storing nutrients. We questioned whether DIT is reliably quantified by indirect calorimetry by employing infrared thermography to independently assess thermogenesis. Thermogenic activity of BAT was stimulated by cold and by a meal that induced a parallel increase in energy production. These stimulatory effects on BAT thermogenesis were inhibited by glucocorticoids. However, glucocorticoids enhanced postprandial EE in the face of reduced BAT thermogenesis and stimulated lipid synthesis. The increase in EE correlated significantly with the increase in lipogenesis. As energy cannot be destroyed (first law of thermodynamics), the energy that would have been dissipated as heat after a meal is channeled into storage. Post-prandial EE is the sum of heat energy that is lost (true DIT) and chemical energy that is stored. Indirect calorimetry does not reliably quantify DIT. When estimated by indirect calorimetry, assumed DIT can be a friend or foe of energy balance. That gas exchange-derived DIT reflects solely energy dissipation as heat is a false assumption likely to explain the conflicting results on the role of DIT in obesity.","['1 Centres for Health ResearchPrincess Alexandra Hospital, The University of Queensland and The Translation Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia k.ho@garvan.org.au.']","Ken K Y Ho, ",The Journal of endocrinology,NO_DATE,energy balance; glucocorticoid; metabolism; obesity; thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29895717
283,Coronavirus interactions with the cellular autophagy machinery,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most recent example of an emergent coronavirus that poses a significant threat to human health. Virus-host interactions play a major role in the viral life cycle and disease pathogenesis, and cellular pathways such as macroautophagy/autophagy prove to be either detrimental or beneficial to viral replication and maturation. Here, we describe the literature over the past twenty years describing autophagy-coronavirus interactions. There is evidence that many coronaviruses induce autophagy, although some of these viruses halt the progression of the pathway prior to autophagic degradation. In contrast, other coronaviruses usurp components of the autophagy pathway in a non-canonical fashion. Cataloging these virus-host interactions is crucial for understanding disease pathogenesis, especially with the global challenge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. With the recognition of autophagy inhibitors, including the controversial drug chloroquine, as possible treatments for COVID-19, understanding how autophagy affects the virus will be critical going forward.

284,Essential Oils as Antiviral Agents. Potential of Essential Oils to Treat SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An In-Silico Investigation,"Essential oils have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses. In this work we hypothesized that essential oil components may interact with key protein targets of the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A molecular docking analysis was carried out using 171 essential oil components with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), SARS-CoV-2 endoribonucleoase (SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/NendoU), SARS-CoV-2 ADP-ribose-1″-phosphatase (SARS-CoV-2 ADRP), SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (SARS-CoV-2 RdRp), the binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 rS), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2). The compound with the best normalized docking score to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (E)-β-farnesene. The best docking ligands for SARS-CoV Nsp15/NendoU were (E,E)-α-farnesene, (E)-β-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol. (E,E)-Farnesol showed the most exothermic docking to SARS-CoV-2 ADRP. Unfortunately, the docking energies of (E,E)-α-farnesene, (E)-β-farnesene, and (E,E)-farnesol with SARS-CoV-2 targets were relatively weak compared to docking energies with other proteins and are, therefore, unlikely to interact with the virus targets. However, essential oil components may act synergistically, essential oils may potentiate other antiviral agents, or they may provide some relief of COVID-19 symptoms.","['1 Laboratório de Biotecnologia de Enzimas e Biotransformações, Universidade Federal do Pará, Belém, PA 66075-900, Brazil.', '2 Departamento de Ciências Naturais, Centro de Ciências Sociais e Educação, Universidade do Estado do Pará, Belém, PA 66050-540, Brazil.', '3 Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL 35899, USA.', '4 Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL 35899, USA.', '5 Aromatic Plant Research Center, 230 N 1200 E, Suite 100, Lehi, UT 84043, USA.']","Joyce Kelly R da Silva, Pablo Luis Baia Figueiredo, Kendall G Byler, William N Setzer, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,COVID−19; antiviral; corona virus; essential oils; molecular docking.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32408699

SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory disease in humans leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The development of effective clinical interventions, such as antivirals and vaccines that can limit or even prevent the burden and spread of SARS-CoV-2, is a global health priority. Testing of leading antivirals, monoclonal antibody therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will require robust animal and cell models of viral pathogenesis. In this Special Article, we discuss the cell-based and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis that have been described as of August 2020. We also outline the outstanding questions for which researchers can leverage animal and cell-based models to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and protective immunity. Taken together, the refinement of models of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be critical to guide the development of therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to end the COVID-19 pandemic.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA david.rafael.martinez@gmail.com.']","Sarah R Leist, Alexandra Schäfer, David R Martinez, ",Disease models & mechanisms,2020,Animal models; Cell models; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32887790

288,Can Bats Serve as Reservoirs for Arboviruses?,"Bats are known to harbor and transmit many emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which are extremely pathogenic in humans but do not cause overt pathology in their bat reservoir hosts: henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), and coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Direct transmission cycles are often implicated in these outbreaks, with virus shed in bat feces, urine, and saliva. An additional mode of virus transmission between bats and humans requiring further exploration is the spread of disease via arthropod vectors. Despite the shared ecological niches that bats fill with many hematophagous arthropods (e.g. mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, etc.) known to play a role in the transmission of medically important arboviruses, knowledge surrounding the potential for bats to act as reservoirs for arboviruses is limited. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken examining the current understanding and potential for bats to act as reservoirs for viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. Serosurveillance and viral isolation from either free-ranging or captive bats are described in relation to four arboviral groups (Bunyavirales, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae). Further, ecological associations between bats and hematophagous viral vectors are characterized (e.g. bat bloodmeals in mosquitoes, ingestion of mosquitoes by bats, etc). Lastly, knowledge gaps related to hematophagous ectoparasites (bat bugs and bed bugs (Cimicidae) and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae)), in addition to future directions for characterization of bat-vector-virus relationships are described.","['1 Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. anna.fagre@colostate.edu.', '2 Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. rebekah.kading@colostate.edu.']","Anna C Fagre, Rebekah C Kading, ",Viruses,2019,arboviruses; bats; reservoir; wildlife; zoonoses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30832426
289,Virological and Immunological Outcomes of Coinfections,"Coinfections involving viruses are being recognized to influence the disease pattern that occurs relative to that with single infection. Classically, we usually think of a clinical syndrome as the consequence of infection by a single virus that is isolated from clinical specimens. However, this biased laboratory approach omits detection of additional agents that could be contributing to the clinical outcome, including novel agents not usually considered pathogens. The presence of an additional agent may also interfere with the targeted isolation of a known virus. Viral interference, a phenomenon where one virus competitively suppresses replication of other coinfecting viruses, is the most common outcome of viral coinfections. In addition, coinfections can modulate virus virulence and cell death, thereby altering disease severity and epidemiology. Immunity to primary virus infection can also modulate immune responses to subsequent secondary infections. In this review, various virological mechanisms that determine viral persistence/exclusion during coinfections are discussed, and insights into the isolation/detection of multiple viruses are provided. We also discuss features of heterologous infections that impact the pattern of immune responsiveness that develops.","['1 Virology Laboratory, National Centre for Veterinary Type Cultures, ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines, Hisar, Haryana, India naveenkumar.icar@gmail.com ssharma3@vols.utk.edu.', '2 Department of Veterinary Physiology and Biochemistry, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar, Haryana, India naveenkumar.icar@gmail.com ssharma3@vols.utk.edu.', '3 Virology Laboratory, National Centre for Veterinary Type Cultures, ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines, Hisar, Haryana, India.', '4 Department of Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA.']","Naveen Kumar, Shalini Sharma, Sanjay Barua, Bhupendra N Tripathi, Barry T Rouse, ",Clinical microbiology reviews,2018,attrition; bystander protection; coinfection; cross reactivity; diverse TCR repertoire; exclusion; persistence; virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976554

In the absence of approved marketed drugs against coronaviruses, the treatment and management of this novel CoV disease (COVID-19) worldwide is a challenge. Drug repurposing that has emerged as an effective drug discovery approach from earlier approved drugs could reduce the time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery. Direct virus-targeted antiviral agents target specific nucleic acid or proteins of the virus while host-based antivirals target either the host innate immune responses or the cellular machineries that are crucial for viral infection. Both the approaches necessarily interfere with viral pathogenesis.

291,Comparative Replication and Immune Activation Profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Human Lungs: An Ex Vivo Study With Implications for the Pathogenesis of COVID-19,"Background:
        
      
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging coronavirus that has resulted in more than 2 000 000 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 145 000 deaths. Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a number of common clinical manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly efficient in person-to-person transmission and frequently causes asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. However, the underlying mechanisms that confer these viral characteristics of high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection remain incompletely understood. Methods:
        
      
      We comprehensively investigated the replication, cell tropism, and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues with SARS-CoV included as a comparison. Results:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated in human lung tissues more efficiently than SARS-CoV. Within the 48-hour interval, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.20-fold more infectious virus particles than did SARS-CoV from the infected lung tissues (P < .024). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar in cell tropism, with both targeting types I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Importantly, despite the more efficient virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues. In addition, while SARS-CoV infection upregulated the expression of 11 out of 13 (84.62%) representative proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection only upregulated 5 of these 13 (38.46%) key inflammatory mediators despite replicating more efficiently. Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study provides the first quantitative data on the comparative replication capacity and immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung tissues.

293,Properties of Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2,"were identified beginning with the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2002. With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (α,β,γ,δ), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under α-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and β-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a β-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","['1 University Malaya, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology, Lembah Pantai, 59100, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. yasmin0220@gmail.com.']","Y A Malik, ",The Malaysian journal of pathology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32342926

It has placed intense pressure on the collective scientific community to develop therapeutics and vaccines, whose engineering relies on a detailed understanding of coronavirus biology. Here, we present the molecular virology of coronavirus infection, including its entry into cells, its remarkably sophisticated gene expression and replication mechanisms, its extensive remodeling of the intracellular environment, and its multifaceted immune evasion strategies.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

      The genome composition, nucleotide analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage, and effective number of codons (ENc) were analyzed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important nonstructural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoVs. Results:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5 to 20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over-biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoV. Conclusion:
        
      
      Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope, and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs.","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-hofuf, Egypt.', '2 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kafrelshikh University, Kafrelshikh, Egypt.', '3 Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-hofuf, Saudi Arabia.', '4 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt.', '5 Al Ahsa Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture, Al-Ahsa, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', '6 Veterinary Serum and Vaccine Institute, Cairo, Egypt.']","Mahmoud Kandeel, Abdelazim Ibrahim, Mahmoud Fayez, Mohammed Al-Nazawi, ",Journal of medical virology,NO_DATE,COVID-19; MERS CoV; SARS-CoV-2; codon bias; nonstructural protein; preferred codons.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32159237
297,Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses that emerged in humans at the beginning of the 21st century. Both viruses likely originated in bats, and genetically diverse coronaviruses that are related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were discovered in bats worldwide. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of these two pathogenic coronaviruses and discuss their receptor usage; we also highlight the diversity and potential of spillover of bat-borne coronaviruses, as evidenced by the recent spillover of swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) to pigs.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '2 Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA.', '3 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.']","Jie Cui, Fang Li, Zheng-Li Shi, ",Nature reviews.

298,"Design of Potent Membrane Fusion Inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, an Emerging Coronavirus with High Fusogenic Activity","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed serious threats to global public health and economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we first verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor and that its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR2) site, than the HR1 sequence in S2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then, we designed an HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly potent activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus transduction. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 was characterized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the results presented here provide important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The S protein of coronaviruses mediates viral receptor binding and membrane fusion, thus being considered a critical target for antivirals. Herein, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has evolved a high level of activity to mediate cell-cell fusion, significantly differing from the S protein of SARS-CoV that emerged previously. The HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a much higher helical stability than the HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV and can interact with the HR2 site to form a six-helical bundle structure more efficiently, underlying the mechanism of the enhanced fusion capacity. Also, importantly, the design of membrane fusion inhibitors with high potencies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has provided potential arsenals to combat the pandemic and tools to exploit the fusion mechanism.","['1 NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', '2 NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China yhe@ipb.pumc.edu.cn.']","Yuanmei Zhu, Danwei Yu, Hongxia Yan, Huihui Chong, Yuxian He, ",Journal of virology,2020,SARS-CoV-2; fusion inhibitor; lipopeptide; membrane fusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32376627
299,"Tropism, replication competence, and innate immune responses of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in human respiratory tract and conjunctiva: an analysis in ex-vivo and in-vitro cultures","Background:
        
      
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, causing a respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) of varying severity in Wuhan, China, and subsequently leading to a pandemic. The transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. We evaluate its tissue and cellular tropism in human respiratory tract, conjunctiva, and innate immune responses in comparison with other coronavirus and influenza virus to provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods:
        
      
      We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient with confirmed COVID-19, and compared virus tropism and replication competence with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm) in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus (n=5) and lung (n=4). We assessed extrapulmonary infection using ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva (n=3) and in-vitro cultures of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Innate immune responses and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression were investigated in human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. In-vitro studies included the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5N1) and mock-infected cells as controls. Findings:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 infected ciliated, mucus-secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes in the lung, and the conjunctival mucosa. In the bronchus, SARS-CoV-2 replication competence was similar to MERS-CoV, and higher than SARS-CoV, but lower than H1N1pdm. In the lung, SARS-CoV-2 replication was similar to SARS-CoV and H1N1pdm, but was lower than MERS-CoV. In conjunctiva, SARS-CoV-2 replication was greater than SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 was a less potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines than H5N1, H1N1pdm, or MERS-CoV. Interpretation:
        
      
      The conjunctival epithelium and conducting airways appear to be potential portals of infection for SARS-CoV-2. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated similarly in the alveolar epithelium; SARS-CoV-2 replicated more extensively in the bronchus than SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into the transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and differences with other respiratory pathogens. Funding:

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specifically binds to the host receptor ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). This interaction promotes endocytosis of the viral particle, additional events leads to viral-host cell membrane fusion and release of the viral contents, allowing viral replication. While SARS-CoV-2 requires BSL-3 facilities for live virus work, pseudotyped partices (PP) that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins without replication elements could facilitate studies on viral entry mechanisms in a BSL-2 setting.

303,Towards an ecology of protective coloration,"The strategies underlying different forms of protective coloration are well understood but little attention has been paid to the ecological, life-history and behavioural circumstances under which they evolve. While some comparative studies have investigated the ecological correlates of aposematism, and background matching, the latter particularly in mammals, few have examined the ecological correlates of other types of protective coloration. Here, we first outline which types of defensive coloration strategies may be exhibited by the same individual; concluding that many protective coloration mechanisms can be employed simultaneously, particularly in conjunction with background matching. Second, we review the ecological predictions that have been made for each sort of protective coloration mechanism before systematically surveying phylogenetically controlled comparative studies linking ecological and social variables to antipredator defences that involve coloration. We find that some a priori predictions based on small-scale empirical studies and logical arguments are indeed supported by comparative data, especially in relation to how illumination affects both background matching and self-shadow concealment through countershading; how body size is associated with countershading, motion dazzle, flash coloration and aposematism, although only in selected taxa; how immobility may promote background matching in ambush predators; and how mobility may facilitate motion dazzle. Examination of nearly 120 comparative tests reveals that many focus on ecological variables that have little to do with predictions derived from antipredator defence theory, and that broad-scale ecological studies of defence strategies that incorporate phylogenetics are still very much in their infancy. We close by making recommendations for future evolutionary ecological research.","['1 School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TQ, U.K.', '2 Center for Population Biology, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, U.S.A.', '3 Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, U.S.A.']","Tim Caro, Manisha Koneru, ",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,NO_DATE,aposematism; comparative studies; crypsis; defence strategies; eco-correlates; evolution of coloration.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258554

I will explore the largely unhelpful symbiotic relationship between 'coincidence' and 'meaning' by comparing synchronicity with synchoricity - coincidence in space rather than time. These two concepts are often mixed together and I will attempt to describe a 'pure' synchronicity in order to sharpen our sense of how meaning is felt to arise from coincidence. It will then be suggested that the standard concept of synchronicity is mostly psychologically irrelevant and, when adjusted to remove elements which are explained quite naturally by evolutionary theory, we are left with a concept which has implications both for the metaphysical foundations of Analytical Psychology and the individualistic emphasis one commonly finds in the field.",['1 Zürich.'],"Philip Kime, ",The Journal of analytical psychology,NO_DATE,Bedeutung; Evolution; Koinzidenz; Synchorozität; Synchronizität; coincidence; coincidencia; coincidenza; evolución; evolution; evoluzione; meaning; sens; significado; significato; sincoricità; sincronicidad; sincronicità; sincroricidad; synchoricity; synchoricité; synchronicity; synchronicité; évolution; синхрония; смысл; совпадение; эволюция; 共时性; 同时发生; 巧合; 意义; 进化.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31659768

In recent years, genomic technologies have provided new analytical solutions that have enhanced our understanding of equine evolution, including the species radiation within Equus; the extinction dynamics of several lineages; and the domestication history of two individual species, the horse and the donkey.

309,Climate change and plant virus epidemiology,"Changes in global climate driven by anthropogenic activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have been progressively increasing and are projected to intensify. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature will have significant consequences for future food production, quality, distribution and security. The epidemiology of plant viruses will be altered in the future as a result of climate change. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, increased temperature, changes to water availability and more frequent extreme weather events will have direct and indirect effects on plant viruses through changes in hosts and vectors. Predicted climatic changes will affect the distribution and survival of plant viruses and their vectors, which are expected to increase in many geographic regions. Furthermore, climate change can affect the virulence and pathogenicity of plant viruses, consequently increasing the frequency and scale of disease outbreaks. Thus, greater understanding of plant virus epidemiology is needed to better anticipate challenges ahead and to develop effective and robust control strategies that will aid in securing global food production for the future.","['1 Agriculture Victoria, 110 Natimuk Rd, Horsham, Victoria, 3400, Australia.

312,Quest for the Best Evolutionary Model,"In the early 1980s, DNA sequencing became a routine and the increasing computing power opened the door to reconstruct molecular phylogenies using probabilistic approaches. DNA sequence alignments provided a large number of positions containing phylogenetic information, which could be extracted using explicit statistical models that described the mutation process using appropriate parameters. Consequently, an active quest started for building increasingly improved (more realistic) statistical models of nucleotide substitution. The simplest model assumed that nucleotide frequencies were in equilibrium and one single category of substitutions. Subsequent models allowed either unequal nucleotide frequencies or separate rates for transitions and transversions. The HKY85 model (Hasegawa et al. in J Mol Evol 22:160, 1985) combined elegantly both options into a single model, which became one of the most useful ones and has been the choice in many molecular phylogenetic studies ever since. The use of improved substitution models such as HKY85 allows reconstructing more accurate and reliable phylogenies, which in turn provide robust frameworks for understanding how biological diversity evolved and for performing a wealth of comparative studies in different disciplines such as ecology, biogeography, developmental biology, biochemistry, genomics, epidemiology, and biomedicine.","['1 Departamento de Biodiversidad y Biología Evolutiva, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC), José Gutiérrez Abascal, 2, 28006, Madrid, Spain. rafaz@mncn.cisc.es.']","Rafael Zardoya, ",Journal of molecular evolution,NO_DATE,Evolutionary models; Maximum likelihood; Molecular phylogenetics; Transitions; Transversions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33201312

The outbreak of this virus has raised a number of questions: what exactly is SARS-CoV-2? How transmissible the novel coronavirus is? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for COVID-19? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, a comparative study of three pathogenic coronaviruses that primarily invade the human respiratory system and may cause death, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This review describes the source of origin, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spreading entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The novel coronavirus spreads faster than its two predecessors - the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV - but has lower fatality rate. The global impact of this new pandemic is still uncertain, but it is a challenge to healthcare systems around the world.","['1 Katedra Nauk Przedklinicznych, Wydział Medycyny Weterynaryjnej SGGW, Warszawa. tdzieciatkowski@wum.edu.pl.', '2 Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Ciudad de México, Mexico. tdzieciatkowski@wum.edu.pl.', '3 Katedra i Zakład Mikrobiologii Lekarskiej, Warszawski Uniwersytet Medyczny, Warszawa. tdzieciatkowski@wum.edu.pl.']","Anna Golke, Karolina Piekarska, Tomasz Dzieciątkowski, ",Postepy biochemii,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470077

Convergent traits that have evolved across pitcher plant lineages are essential for trap function, suggesting that key selective pressures are in action. Recent studies have also revealed patterns of divergent evolution in functional pitcher morphology within genera.

319,SARS-CoV-2: a new dimension to our understanding of coronaviruses,"Coronaviruses have marked their significant emergence since the twenty-first century with the outbreaks of three out of the seven existing human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. These viruses have not only acquired large-scale transmission during their specified outbreak period, but cases of MERS-CoV still remain active, although there is only limited transmission. While, on the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain a rising threat to global public health. The recent novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has repeatedly raised questions about its characteristic variability. Despite belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be quite difficult to control and contain in terms of transmissibility, leading to around 19.8 million reported cases and more than 730,000 deaths of individuals worldwide. Here, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 differs from its two other related human coronaviruses in terms of genome composition, site of infection, and transmissibility, among several other notable aspects-all indicating to the possibility that it is these variations in addition to other unknowns that are contributing to this virus' differing deadly pattern.","['1 Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh.', '2 Biotechnology Program, Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, School of Data and Sciences, BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.', '3 Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', '4 Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh. jakir-gen@sust.edu.']","Yusha Araf, Nairita Ahsan Faruqui, Saeed Anwar, Mohammad Jakir Hosen, ",International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,NO_DATE,ACE2; Case fatality rate; Coronavirus; Genome; MERS; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; Transmissibility.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33231780
320,The evolution of evolution,"In the past, most biologists, myself included, did not think of evolution as changing over time. The wonders of natural selection were always at hand and went into operation once there was life. However, with a little reflection it becomes obvious that evolution has changed-there has been an evolution of evolution. Evolution can be separated into four phases, or eras, that may or may not overlap. The first era starts with the evolution of life on earth, which led to single cells that multiply asexually. The second era takes advantage of the invention of sexual reproduction as evolution could now gallop forward because of a richer fare of diverse offspring for natural selection. The third era begins with the introduction of multicellularity. In the fourth era there is a radical innovation: the nervous system that arises animals by standard Darwinian selection. This has allowed major rapid changes to proceed, such as language that led to all the rapid progress we call civilization; a true revolution, and one that does not depend on the slow genetic changes of all other standard gene-controlled evolutionary steps.","['1 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Princeton, Princeton, New Jersey.']","John T Bonner, ","Journal of experimental zoology.

Thus, hypotheses regarding the function of spatial patterns must account for the acuity of relevant viewers. New data quantifying acuity in a range of taxa allow us to examine correlations between acuity and ecology, elucidate the selective forces that receiver acuity places on signal evolution, and examine how signals might appear to viewers with different acuities.","['1 Duke University Biology Department, Box 90338, Durham NC 27708, USA.

322,"Immune Responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","The world has given an outbreak alarm in the last two decades, with different members of the coronavirus family infecting people at different times. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which last appeared in December 2019 in China and spread rapidly to all over the world, has led the scientific world to studies on these viruses. While scientists are trying to develop vaccines or drugs against the virus, the body's immune response to the virus is emerged the biggest guide. In this review, we aimed to provide a good view on immune strategies by comparing immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 disease among other members of the family, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In the near future, it may contribute to vaccine or drug studies to be developed on immune intervention.","['1 Department of Medical Biology, Yozgat Bozok University Faculty of Medicine, Yozgat, Turkey.', '2 Department of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Marmara University Faculty of Medicine, İstanbul, Turkey. tuncakkoc@marmara.edu.tr.']","Nihal İnandıklıoğlu, Tunc Akkoc, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,NO_DATE,Corona virus; Covid-19; Immune response; Mers-CoV; Sars-CoV.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32514817

Here, we briefly review the general concept of redundancy and focus on the evolutionary importance of redundancy in terms of the number of genotypes that give rise to the same phenotype. We discuss the challenges in determining redundancy empirically, with published experimental examples, and demonstrate the use of the C-score metric to quantify redundancy in evolution studies. We contrast the implicit assumptions of redundancy in quantitative versus population genetic models, show how this contributes to signatures of allele frequency shifts, and highlight how the rapid accumulation of genome-wide association data provides an avenue for further understanding the prevalence and role of redundancy in evolution.","['1 Northeastern University Marine Science Center, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908, USA.

324,Viruses in Polar Lake and Soil Ecosystems,"Viruses play an important role in the control of microbial communities, and it has been suggested that the influence of viruses in polar ecosystems, with low nutrients and under extreme environmental conditions, may be greater. Viral metagenomics allows the genetic characterization of complex viral communities without the need to isolate and grow viruses. Recent investigations in Antarctica and the Arctic are uncovering a great diversity of DNA viruses, including bacteriophages, circular single-stranded DNA viruses, algal-infecting phycodnaviruses, and virophages, adapted to these extreme environments. The limited sequence similarity between viruses in Antarctica and the Arctic suggests that viral communities in the two polar regions have evolved independently since the formation of the Antarctic continent, estimated to occur 25 million years ago. The community of RNA viruses in Antarctica is dominated by the order Picornavirales and their quasispecies composition suggests that higher genetic variability may correlate with viral adaptation to new environmental conditions.","['1 Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain.', '2 Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain.

326,Detection of viruses by inflammasomes,"The innate immune system has evolved mechanisms to keep the viral infection under control and repair damaged tissues. Several pathways can identify the presence of pathogenic components, such as viral nucleic acids and viral proteins. Also, the innate immune system can detect cellular and tissue perturbations caused by infections. Inflammasomes are cellular pieces of machinery that can detect a pathogen's presence and its possible impact on cellular integrity. Thereby several inflammasomes, including the NLRP3 inflammasome and the AIM2 inflammasome, contribute to antiviral innate immunity. Inflammation driven by inflammasomes promotes immune defenses and initiate repair mechanisms. However, its overactivation may trigger acute inflammatory responses that may harm the host. This pathologic activation could contribute to the hyperinflammatory response observed in patients infected with viruses, including influenza, SARS, and possibly SARS-CoV2.","['1 Departement of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Epalinges 1066, Switzerland.', '2 Departement of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Epalinges 1066, Switzerland.

Although currently with a rather low mortality rate, the virus spread rapidly over the world using the modern world's traffic highways. The coronavirus (CoV) family members were responsible for several deadly outbreaks and epidemics during the last decade. Not only governments but also the scientific community reacted promptly to the outbreak, and information is shared quickly. For example, the genetic fingerprint was shared, and the 3D structure of key proteins was rapidly solved, which can be used for the discovery of potential treatments. An overview is given on the current knowledge of the spread, disease course, and molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss potential treatment developments in the context of recent outbreaks, drug repurposing, and development timelines.","['1 Department of Pharmacy, Drug Design Group, University of Groningen, A.

328,Structure and assembly of archaeal viruses,"Viruses of archaea represent one of the most enigmatic parts of the virosphere. Most of the characterized archaeal viruses infect extremophilic hosts and display remarkable diversity of virion morphotypes, many of which have never been observed among bacteriophages or viruses of eukaryotes. However, recent environmental studies have shown that archaeal viruses are widespread also in moderate ecosystems, where they play an important ecological role by influencing the turnover of microbial communities, with a global impact on the carbon and nitrogen cycles. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the molecular details of virion organization and assembly of archaeal viruses. We start by briefly introducing the 20 officially recognized families of archaeal viruses and then outline the similarities and differences of archaeal virus assembly with the morphogenesis pathways used by bacterial and eukaryotic viruses, and discuss the evolutionary implications of these observations. Generally, the assembly of the icosahedral archaeal viruses closely follows the mechanisms employed by evolutionarily related bacterial and eukaryotic viruses with the HK97 fold and double jelly-roll major capsid proteins, emphasizing the overall conservation of these pathways over billions of years of evolution. By contrast, archaea-specific viruses employ unique virion assembly mechanisms. We also highlight some of the molecular adaptations underlying the stability of archaeal viruses in extreme environments. Despite considerable progress during the past few years, the archaeal virosphere continues to represent one of the least studied parts of the global virome, with many molecular features awaiting to be discovered and characterized.","['1 Archaeal Virology Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Sorbonne Université, Collège Doctoral, Paris, France.', '2 Archaeal Virology Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', '3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States.', '4 Archaeal Virology Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, Tbilisi, Georgia.', '5 Archaeal Virology Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.

The infection has now been transmitted to more than 210 countries worldwide and caused more than 200,000 deaths. Similar to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 appears to less commonly affect pediatrics and to cause less severe disease along with fewer symptoms compared to adults. Available data suggest that the pediatric population is just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2.

We highlight outstanding questions about the earliest phases of placental mammal diversification and the promise of newer methods, as well as remaining challenges, toward using whole genome data to resolve placental mammal phylogeny. The next phase of mammalian comparative genomics will see the completion and application of finished-quality, gapless genome assemblies from many ordinal lineages and closely related species.

334,A developmental perspective on the evolution of the nervous system,"The evolution of nervous systems in animals has always fascinated biologists, and thus multiple evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain the appearance of neurons and complex neuronal centers. However, the absence of a robust phylogenetic framework for animal interrelationships, the lack of a mechanistic understanding of development, and a recapitulative view of animal ontogeny have traditionally limited these scenarios. Only recently, the integration of advanced molecular and morphological studies in a broad range of animals has allowed to trace the evolution of developmental and neuronal characters on a better-resolved animal phylogeny. This has falsified most traditional scenarios for nervous system evolution, paving the way for the emergence of new testable hypotheses. Here we summarize recent progress in studies of nervous system development in major animal lineages and formulate some of the arising questions. In particular, we focus on how lineage analyses of nervous system development and a comparative study of the expression of neural-related genes has influenced our understanding of the evolution of an elaborated central nervous system in Bilateria. We argue that a phylogeny-guided study of neural development combining thorough descriptive and functional analyses is key to establish more robust scenarios for the origin and evolution of animal nervous systems.","['1 Sars International Centre for Marine Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, Thørmohlensgate 55, 5006, Bergen, Norway; School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, Mile End Road, E1 4NS, London, UK.

      The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of respiratory virus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during the winter period December 2019 to March 2020, via a tertiary care hospital-based survey in Parma, Northern Italy. Methods:
        
      
      A total of 906 biological samples from the respiratory tract were analysed by both conventional assays (including culture) and molecular assays targeting nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Results:
        
      
      Overall, 474 samples (52.3%) were positive for at least one virus, with a total of 583 viruses detected. Single infections were detected in 380 (80.2%) samples and mixed infections were detected in 94 (19.8%). Respiratory syncytial virus (138/583, 23.7%) and rhinovirus (130/583, 22.3%) were the most commonly identified viruses, followed by SARS-CoV-2 (82/583, 14.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus predominated until February, with 129 detections; it then decreased drastically in March to only nine detections. SARS-CoV-2 was absent in the study area until February 26, 2020 and then reached 82 detections in just over a month. SARS-CoV-2 was found in mixed infections in only three cases, all observed in children younger than 1 year old. Conclusions:
        
      
      This study showed a completely different trend between SARS-CoV-2 and the 'common' respiratory viruses: the common viruses mostly affected children, without any distinction according to sex, while SARS-CoV-2 mostly affected adult males.","['1 Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Viale A.

The development of antiviral agents against these viruses is urgently needed. We have previously discovered that the Keggin structured polyoxometalate POM-12 has potent inhibitory activity against hepatitis C virus, another member of the Flaviviridae family. In this study, we tested its antiviral activity of DENV, JEV and ZIKV, and found that POM-12 dramatically inhibited their infection with IC50 value of 1.16 μM, 1.9 μM and 0.64 μM, respectively. Mechanistic studies indicated that POM-12 directly disrupted the integrity of these virions. Moreover, POM-12 also targeted the post-entry steps of viral replication of JEV, but having no similar activities on ZIKV and DENV. The differential actions of POM-12 on these viruses suggest that surface topology and charge of virion may have influence on its drug effect, and thus POM-12 may be modified to more efficiently inhibit these and other similar viruses.","['1 Department of Hepatology, First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, 130021, China.

337,ComBATing aging-does increased brown adipose tissue activity confer longevity?,"Brown and its related beige adipose tissue (BAT) play a definitive role in maintaining body temperature by producing heat through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which acts by dissociating oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production, resulting in the release of heat. Therefore, in order to maintain high thermogenic capacity, BAT must act as a metabolic sink by taking up vast amounts of circulating glucose and lipids for oxidation. This, along with the rediscovery of BAT in adult humans, has fueled the study of BAT as a putative therapeutic approach to manage the growing rates of obesity and metabolic syndromes. Notably, many of the beneficial consequences of BAT activity overlap with metabolic biomarkers of extended lifespan and healthspan. In this review, we provide background about BAT including the thermogenic program, BAT's role as a secretory organ, and differences between BAT in mice and humans. We also provide details on BAT during aging, and perspectives on the potential of targeting BAT to promote lifespan and healthspan.","['1 Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, One Joslin Place, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', '2 Section on Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, One Joslin Place, Boston, MA, 02215, USA. yu-hua.tseng@joslin.harvard.edu.', '3 Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. yu-hua.tseng@joslin.harvard.edu.']","Justin Darcy, Yu-Hua Tseng, ",GeroScience,NO_DATE,Aging; Brown adipose tissue; Metabolism; Thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230192
338,Brown and Brite: The Fat Soldiers in the Anti-obesity Fight,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is proposed to maintain thermal homeostasis through dissipation of chemical energy as heat by the uncoupling proteins (UCPs) present in their mitochondria. The recent demonstration of the presence of BAT in humans has invigorated research in this area. The research has provided many new insights into the biology and functioning of this tissue and the biological implications of its altered activities. Another finding of interest is browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) resulting in what is known as beige/brite cells, which have increased mitochondrial proteins and UCPs. In general, it has been observed that the activation of BAT is associated with various physiological improvements such as a reduction in blood glucose levels increased resting energy expenditure and reduced weight. Given the similar physiological functions of BAT and beige/ brite cells and the higher mass of WAT compared to BAT, it is likely that increasing the brite/beige cells in WATs may also lead to greater metabolic benefits. However, development of treatments targeting brown fat or WAT browning would require not only a substantial understanding of the biology of these tissues but also the effect of altering their activity levels on whole body metabolism and physiology. In this review, we present evidence from recent literature on the substrates utilized by BAT, regulation of BAT activity and browning by circulating molecules. We also present dietary and pharmacological activators of brown and beige/brite adipose tissue and the effect of physical exercise on BAT activity and browning.","['1 Systems Biology for Biofuels Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India.', '2 Laboratory of Metabolic Control, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, United States.']","Shireesh Srivastava, Richard L Veech, ",Frontiers in physiology,2019,brown fat; dietary additive; exercise; hormones; metabolism.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30761017

342,Autophagy in Plant-Virus Interactions,"Autophagy is a conserved vacuole/lysosome-mediated degradation pathway for clearing and recycling cellular components including cytosol, macromolecules, and dysfunctional organelles. In recent years, autophagy has emerged to play important roles in plant-pathogen interactions. It acts as an antiviral defense mechanism in plants. Moreover, increasing evidence shows that plant viruses can manipulate, hijack, or even exploit the autophagy pathway to promote pathogenesis, demonstrating the pivotal role of autophagy in the evolutionary arms race between hosts and viruses. In this review, we discuss recent findings about the antiviral and proviral roles of autophagy in plant-virus interactions.","['1 MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Center for Plant Biology, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; email: yuleliu@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn.']","Meng Yang, Asigul Ismayil, Yule Liu, ",Annual review of virology,2020,autophagy; counter-defense; defense; interaction; plant; virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32530794

344,The role of brown and beige adipose tissue in glycaemic control,"For the past decade, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been extensively studied as a potential therapy for obesity and metabolic diseases due to its thermogenic and glucose-consuming properties. It is now clear that the function of BAT goes beyond heat production, as it also plays an important endocrine role by secreting the so-called batokines to communicate with other metabolic tissues and regulate systemic energy homeostasis. However, despite numerous studies showing the benefits of BAT in rodents, it is still not clear whether recruitment of BAT can be utilized to treat human patients. Here, we review the advances on understanding the role of BAT in metabolism and its benefits on glucose and lipid homeostasis in both humans and rodents. Moreover, we discuss the latest methodological approaches to assess the contribution of BAT to human metabolism as well as the possibility to target BAT, pharmacologically or by lifestyle adaptations, to treat metabolic disorders.","['1 Institute for Diabetes and Cancer, Helmholtz Center Munich, Neuherberg, Germany; Joint Heidelberg-IDC Translational Diabetes Program, Heidelberg University Hospital, Inner Medicine 1, Heidelberg, Germany; Deutsches Zentrum für Diabetesforschung, Neuherberg, Germany.', '2 Deutsches Zentrum für Diabetesforschung, Neuherberg, Germany.', '3 Institute for Diabetes and Cancer, Helmholtz Center Munich, Neuherberg, Germany; Joint Heidelberg-IDC Translational Diabetes Program, Heidelberg University Hospital, Inner Medicine 1, Heidelberg, Germany; Deutsches Zentrum für Diabetesforschung, Neuherberg, Germany; Chair Molecular Metabolic Control, Technical University Munich, Germany.

345,Repeatability of Radiomic Features of Brown Adipose Tissue,"The aim of this study was to assess the repeatability of activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) radiomic features. To decipher radiomic features that may provide useful information on BAT, the impact of reconstruction methods and imaging modality choice was also evaluated. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy adults enrolled in this study. After a cooling procedure to activate BAT, volunteers underwent 18F-FDG imaging. Participants underwent repeat imaging using the same imaging protocols and a similar 18F-FDG dose within 14 d. Active BAT was segmented using the BARCIST 1.0 methods. Radiomic features were extracted from each region of interest on high-definition PET (HD PET), non-HD PET, and CT images. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was used to estimate the repeatability of the extracted radiomic features. To determine whether BAT radiomic feature repeatability correlates with BAT SUVmax repeatability, participants were stratified based on the relative difference in SUVmax between sessions. Non-HD PET repeatable features were clustered together using hierarchical clustering, and the normalized dynamic range of each feature was computed to identify the most informative feature within each cluster. Results: Eighteen of the 27 volunteers had sufficient BAT activity for radiomic analysis. Sixty-six HD PET, 66 non-HD PET, and 6 CT features showed high repeatability (concordance correlation coefficient ≥ 0.80). Feature repeatability was significantly higher for PET than for CT, but there was no statistically significant difference between HD and non-HD PET in radiomic feature repeatability. The repeatability of radiomic features extracted from each modality and reconstruction method type followed the trend in SUVmax, as participants with lower relative differences in SUVmax between initial and repeated imaging sessions had higher radiomic feature repeatability. Hierarchical clustering of the high-repeatability PET features resulted in 10 highly correlated clusters (R2 ≥ 0.95). Seven features, including SUVmax, did not cluster with any other features. Conclusion: Several clusters of highly repeatable BAT radiomic features derived from 18F-FDG PET/CT appear to provide information regarding BAT activity distinct from SUVmax These features might be explored as quantitative imaging biomarkers of BAT activity in future studies.","['1 Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', '2 Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri rwahl@wustl.edu.']","Aria Nazeri, John P Crandall, Tyler J Fraum, Richard L Wahl, ","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2021,PET/CT; brown adipose tissue; radiomics; repeatability; texture analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33037091
346,Establishment and Application of Flavivirus Replicons,"Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. The genome of ~11 kb length encodes one long open reading frame flanked by a 5' and a 3' untranslated region (UTR). The 5' end is capped and the 3' end lacks a poly(A) tail. The encoded single polyprotein is cleaved co-and posttranslationally by cellular and viral proteases. The first one-third of the genome encodes the structural proteins (C-prM-E), whereas the nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1-NS2A-NS3-NS4A-2K-NS4B-NS5 are encoded by the remaining two-thirds of the genome.Research on flaviviruses was driven forward by the ability to produce recombinant viruses using reverse genetics technology. It is known that the purified RNA of flaviviruses is per se infectious, which allows initiation of a complete viral life cycle by transfecting the genomic RNA into susceptible cells. In 1989, the first infectious flavivirus RNA was transcribed from full-length cDNA templates of yellow fever virus (YFV) facilitating molecular genetic analyses of this virus. In addition to the production of infectious recombinant viruses, reverse genetics can also be used to establish non-infectious replicons. Replicons contain an in-frame deletion in the structural protein genes but still encode all nonstructural proteins and contain the UTRs necessary to mediate efficient replication, a factor that enables their analyses under Biosafety Level (BSL) 1 conditions. This is particularly important since many flaviviruses are BSL3 agents.The review will cover strategies for generating flavivirus replicons, including the establishment of bacteriophage (T7 or SP6) promoter-driven constructs as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven constructs. Furthermore, different reporter replicons or replicons expressing selectable marker proteins will be outlined using examples of their application to answer basic questions of the flavivirus replication cycle, to select and test antiviral compounds or to produce virus replicon particles. The establishment and application of flavivirus replicons will further be exemplified by my own data using an established YFV reporter replicon to study the role of YFV NS2A in the viral life cycle. In addition, we established a reporter replicon of a novel insect-specific flavivirus, namely Niénokoué virus (NIEV), to define the barrier(s) involved in host range restriction.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany. kuemmerer@virology-bonn.de.', '2 German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) Partner site Bonn-Cologne, Bonn, Germany. kuemmerer@virology-bonn.de.']","Beate M Kümmerer, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,NO_DATE,Flavivirus reverse genetics technology; Niénokoué virus; Non-infectious replicons; Selectable marker proteins; Yellow fever virus NS2A protein.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29845532

348,Studying Brown Adipose Tissue in a Human in vitro Context,"New treatments for obesity and associated metabolic disease are increasingly warranted with the growth of the obesity pandemic. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) may represent a promising therapeutic target to treat obesity, as this tissue has been shown to regulate energy expenditure through non-shivering thermogenesis. Three different strategies could be employed for therapeutic targeting of human thermogenic adipocytes: increasing BAT mass through stimulation of BAT progenitors, increasing BAT function through regulatory pathways, and increasing WAT browning through promotion of beige adipocyte formation. However, these strategies require deeper understanding of human brown and beige adipocytes. While murine studies have greatly increased our understanding of BAT, it is becoming clear that human BAT does not exactly resemble that of the mouse, highlighting the need for human in vitro models of brown adipocytes. Several different human brown adipocyte models will be discussed here, along with the potential to improve brown adipocyte culture through recreation of the BAT microenvironment.","['1 Metabolic Research Laboratories, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Cellular Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute (WT), Hinxton, United Kingdom.']","Isabella Samuelson, Antonio Vidal-Puig, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,3D culture; HPSC model; beige adipocyte; brown adipogenesis; brown adipose tissue (BAT); human adipocytes; obesity; thermogenic adipocyte differentiation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33042008
349,The Role of Mutation Bias in Adaptive Evolution,"Mutational input is the ultimate source of genetic variation, but mutations are not thought to affect the direction of adaptive evolution. Recently, critics of standard evolutionary theory have questioned the random and non-directional nature of mutations, claiming that the mutational process can be adaptive in its own right. We discuss here mutation bias in adaptive evolution. We find little support for mutation bias as an independent force in adaptive evolution, although it can interact with selection under conditions of small population size and when standing genetic variation is limited, entirely consistent with standard evolutionary theory. We further emphasize that natural selection can shape the phenotypic effects of mutations, giving the false impression that directed mutations are driving adaptive evolution.","['1 Department of Biology, Lund University, SE-223 62 Lund, Sweden.

DVGs are produced by many viruses, and their presence correlates with alterations in infection outcomes. Historically, DVGs were studied for their ability to interfere with standard virus replication as well as for their association with viral persistence. More recently, a critical role for DVGs in inducing the innate immune response during infection was appreciated. Here we review the role of DVGs of RNA viruses in shaping outcomes of experimental as well as natural infections and explore the mechanisms by which DVGs impact infection outcome.","['1 Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA; email: lopezca@upenn.edu.']","Emmanuelle Genoyer, Carolina B López, ",Annual review of virology,2019,antiviral immunity; defective interfering particles; defective viral genomes; defective virus; viral interference.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31082310
351,Simian Foamy Virus Co-Infections,"Foamy viruses (FVs), also known as spumaretroviruses, are complex retroviruses that are seemingly nonpathogenic in natural hosts. In natural hosts, which include felines, bovines, and nonhuman primates (NHPs), a large percentage of adults are infected with FVs. For this reason, the effect of FVs on infections with other viruses (co-infections) cannot be easily studied in natural populations. Most of what is known about interactions between FVs and other viruses is based on studies of NHPs in artificial settings such as research facilities. In these settings, there is some indication that FVs can exacerbate infections with lentiviruses such as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Nonhuman primate (NHP) simian FVs (SFVs) have been shown to infect people without any apparent pathogenicity. Humans zoonotically infected with simian foamy virus (SFV) are often co-infected with other viruses. Thus, it is important to know whether SFV co-infections affect human disease.","['1 Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. smurray@fredhutch.org.', '2 Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. mlinial@fredhutch.org.']","Shannon M Murray, Maxine L Linial, ",Viruses,2019,NHP; co-infections; foamy virus; pathogenesis; spumaretrovirus; zoonoses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31569704

353,Conceptualizing plant systems evolution,"Organisms inhabiting extreme environments are emerging models in systems evolution, enabling us to identify the molecular alterations effecting major phenotypic divergence through comparative approaches. Here I discuss possible physiological mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptations to extreme environments both theoretically and in relation to experimental observations. Reasoning leads me to the 'conserved steady-state' hypothesis of evolutionary adaptation: Between closely related plants adapted to differently composed soils, the homeostatically controlled steady-state set point cytosolic (buffered) concentrations of mineral ions are conserved. Subsequently, I compare molecular alterations expected to contribute to physiological adaptations with our present knowledge. Key roles of enhanced gene product dosage in plant evolutionary adaptations question the widespread stimulus response-centric paradigm. As a broader implication, co-regulation networks can lack decisive functional network elements. With this article, I hope to stimulate a discussion across research fields and provide an initial conceptual framework for future experimental testing and for quantitative modelling.","['1 Molecular Genetics and Physiology of Plants, Ruhr University Bochum, Universitätsstraße 150, ND3/30, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.

354,Giant mimiviruses escape many canonical criteria of the virus definition,"Background:
        
      
      The discovery of mimivirus in 2003 prompted the quest for other giant viruses of amoebae. Mimiviruses and their relatives were found to differ considerably from other viruses. Their study led to major advances in virology and evolutionary biology. Aims:
        
      
      We summarized the widening gap between mimiviruses and other viruses. Sources:
        
      
      We collected data from articles retrieved from PubMed using as keywords 'giant virus', 'mimivirus' and 'virophage', as well as quoted references from these articles. Content:
        
      
      Data accumulated during the last 15 years on mimiviruses and other giant viruses highlight that there is a quantum leap between these infectious agents, the complexity of which is similar to that of intracellular microorganisms, and classical viruses. Notably, in addition to their giant structures and genomes, giant viruses have abundant gene repertoires with genes unique in the virosphere, including a tremendous set of translation components. The viruses contain hundreds of proteins and many transcripts. They share a core of central and ancient proteins but their genome sequences display a substantial level of mosaicism. Finally, mimiviruses have a specific mobilome, including virophages that can integrate into their genomes, and against which they can defend themselves through integration of short fragments of the DNA of these invaders. Implications:
        
      
      Mimiviruses and subsequently discovered giant viruses have changed the virus paradigm and contradict many virus definition criteria delineated for classical viruses. The major cellular hallmark that is still lacking in giant viruses is the ribosome, including both ribosomal protein and RNA encoding genes, which makes them bona fide microbes without ribosomes.","['1 Aix-Marseille Université, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille (AP-HM); Microbes, Evolution, Phylogeny and Infection (MEΦI); Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) - Méditerranée Infection, 19-21 boulevard Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France.', '2 Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Science & Medical Systems Business Group, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', '3 Hitachi Ltd, Research & Development Group, Saitama, Japan.', '4 Aix-Marseille Université, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille (AP-HM); Microbes, Evolution, Phylogeny and Infection (MEΦI); Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) - Méditerranée Infection, 19-21 boulevard Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France.

355,Inflammatory Signaling and Brown Fat Activity,"Obesity is characterized by a state of chronic inflammation in adipose tissue mediated by the secretion of a range of inflammatory cytokines. In comparison to WAT, relatively little is known about the inflammatory status of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in physiology and pathophysiology. Because BAT and brown/beige adipocytes are specialized in energy expenditure they have protective roles against obesity and associated metabolic diseases. BAT appears to be is less susceptible to developing inflammation than WAT. However, there is increasing evidence that inflammation directly alters the thermogenic activity of brown fat by impairing its capacity for energy expenditure and glucose uptake. The inflammatory microenvironment can be affected by cytokines secreted by immune cells as well as by the brown adipocytes themselves. Therefore, pro-inflammatory signals represent an important component of the thermogenic potential of brown and beige adipocytes and may contribute their dysfunction in obesity.","['1 Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom.', '2 Department of Biosciences, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']","Farah Omran, Mark Christian, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,beige adipocyte; brown adipose tissue (BAT); cytokine; inflammation; white adipose tissue.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32265845

We designed a spatial observational-learning task, in which an observer bat mimicked a demonstrator bat while we recorded hippocampal dorsal-CA1 neurons from the observer bat. A neuronal subpopulation represented the position of the other bat, in allocentric coordinates. About half of these ""social place-cells"" represented also the observer's own position-that is, were place cells. The representation of the demonstrator bat did not reflect self-movement or trajectory planning by the observer. Some neurons represented also the position of inanimate moving objects; however, their representation differed from the representation of the demonstrator bat. This suggests a role for hippocampal CA1 neurons in social-spatial cognition.","['1 Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel. nachum.ulanovsky@weizmann.ac.il liora.las@weizmann.ac.il.']","David B Omer, Shir R Maimon, Liora Las, Nachum Ulanovsky, ","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29326274

Also recombinant measles virus (MeV) is developed as an oncolytic virus. Because of its high genetic flexibility, a number of different MeV strains have been the basis for the generation of targeted, armed, or shielded viruses that are highly specific for a given tumor target, more effective, or protected against serum neutralization. Such MeV have been extensively tested in vitro and in vivo, whereby remarkable oncolytic potency is accompanied by safety also in non-human primates. Therefore, MeV has been introduced into 19 different clinical trials and has reached phase II against two different tumor entities, multiple myeloma and ovarian carcinoma. Remarkably, one patient with advanced stage myeloma experienced long-term remission after treatment, visualizing the potency of this approach.","['1 Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 51-59, D-63225 Langen, Germany.

358,Contribution of brown adipose tissue to human energy metabolism,"The present ""obesogenic' environment has favored excessive energy intake resulting in the current obesity epidemic and its associated diseases. The epidemic has incentivized scientists to develop novel behavioral and pharmacological strategies that enhance energy expenditure to compensate for excessive energy intake. Although physical activity is effective to increase total energy expenditure, it is insufficient to induce negative energy balance and weight loss. With the discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans, BAT activation soon emerged as a potential strategy for elevating energy expenditure. BAT is the only tissue that expresses uncoupling protein 1, conferring on this tissue high thermogenic capacity due to a low efficiency for mitochondrial ATP generation. Potential manipulation of BAT mass and activity has fueled the interest in altering whole-body energy balance through increased energy expenditure. Remarkable advances have been made in quantifying the amount and activity of BAT in humans. Many studies have concluded that the amount of active BAT appears insufficient to induce meaningful increases in energy expenditure. Thus, the majority of studies report that BAT activation does not influence body weight and metabolic control in humans. Strategies to increase BAT mass and/or to potentiate BAT activity seem necessary.","['1 Departamento de Ciencias de la Salud. Carrera de Nutrición y Dietética. Facultad de Medicina.

359,Dietary polyphenols and their roles in fat browning,"Discovery of the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in newborn babies and adult humans, especially constitutively active brown fat or inducible beige fat, has led to the investigation of strategies employing BAT aimed at the development of novel therapeutic avenues for combating obesity and diabetes. Such antiobesity therapeutic tools include pharmaceutical and nutraceutical dietary polyphenols. Although there have been emerging notable advances in knowledge of and an increased amount of research related to brown and beige adipocyte developmental lineages and transcriptional regulators, current knowledge regarding whether and how food factors and environmental modifiers of BAT influence thermogenesis has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, in this review, we summarized recent updates on the exploration of dietary polyphenols while paying attention to the activation of BAT and thermogenesis. Specifically, we summarized findings pertaining to BAT metabolism, white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and thermogenic function of polyphenols (e.g., flavan-3-ols, green tea catechins, resveratrol, capsaicin/capsinoids, curcumin, thymol, chrysin, quercetin and berberine) that may foster a relatively safe and effective therapeutic option to improve metabolic health. We also deciphered the underlying proposed mechanisms through which these dietary polyphenols facilitate BAT activity and WAT browning. Characterization of thermogenic dietary factors may offer novel insight enabling revision of nutritional intervention strategies aimed at obesity and diabetes prevention and management. Moreover, identification of polyphenolic dietary factors among plant-derived natural compounds may provide information that facilitates nutritional intervention strategies against obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.","['1 Department of Biotechnology, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk 38453, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Biotechnology, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk 38453, Republic of Korea.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics provide scientific data that is useful in better understanding and resolution of COVID-19. Similarities among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated in the light of available data. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 evolved in bats and have positive-sense RNA genomes of 27.9 kb, 30.1 kb and 29.9 kb, respectively. Molecular and serological tools used for diagnosis of SARS and MERS patients resemble COVID-19 diagnostic tools. Stability and longevity data of SARS and MERS epidemics contribute in the current pandemic precaution policies. Trials to produce vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV failed, therefore different strategies were employed for SARS-CoV2 vaccines production and during the past period antiviral agents, Convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies provide potential treatments for sever patients. The mortality rate caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reached 15% and 37%, respectively.

361,Substrate Utilization by Brown Adipose Tissue: What's Hot and What's Not?,"Our understanding of brown adipose tissue (BAT) function in humans has increased rapidly over the past 10 years. This is predominantly due to the development of powerful non-invasive imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography that can quantify BAT mass and function using metabolic tracers. Activation of BAT during cold-induced thermogenesis is an effective way to dissipate energy to generate heat and requires utilization of multiple energy substrates for optimal function. This has led to interest in the activation of BAT as a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and obesity. Here, we provide an overview of the current understanding of BAT substrate utilization in humans and highlight additional mechanisms found in rodents, where BAT more prominently contributes to energy expenditure. During thermogenesis, BAT demonstrates substantially increased glucose uptake which appears to be critical for BAT function. However, glucose is not fully oxidized, with a large proportion converted to lactate. The primary energy substrate for thermogenesis is fatty acids, released from brown adipocyte triglyceride stores. Active BAT also sequesters circulating lipids to sustain optimal thermogenesis. Recent evidence reveals that metabolic intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolytic pathways also play a critical role in BAT function. Understanding the role of these metabolites in regulating thermogenesis and whole body substrate utilization may elucidate novel strategies for therapeutic BAT activation.","[""1 University/BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.""]","Ben T McNeill, Nicholas M Morton, Roland H Stimson, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,brown adipose tissue; glucose; lipids; metabolism; obesity; positron emission tomography (PET); substrate; thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33101206

363,COVID-19: From bench to bed side,"Background and aims:
        
      
      The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know. Methods:
        
      
      We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics. Results:
        
      
      Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion:
        
      
      Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.","['1 College of Medicine & JNM Hospital, Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal, India.', '2 Saifee Hospital, Mumbai, India.', '3 G.

364,Pathogenic viruses: Molecular detection and characterization,"Pathogenic viruses are viruses that can infect and replicate within human cells and cause diseases. The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a local capacity to rapidly identify new viruses is therefore critical. This article reviews the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the basic principles of molecular techniques commonly used for their detection and characterization. The principles of good laboratory practices for handling pathogenic viruses are also discussed. This review aims at providing researchers and laboratory personnel with an overview of the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the principles of molecular techniques and good laboratory practices commonly implemented for their detection and characterization.","['1 Biosafety Level 3 Unit, Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology, Jalan Diponegoro 69, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bogor Agricultural University, Darmaga Campus, Bogor 16680, Indonesia.

365,Emerging viruses in aquaculture,"Aquaculture remains the world's fastest-growing sector producing food of animal origin. Unlike in terrestrial animal agriculture, in aquaculture both farmed and wild aquatic animals in the same water column experience the same virus challenges. Additionally, the burgeoning international aquaculture expansion and expanding global trade in live aquatic animals and their products have been accompanied by long distance geographical redistribution of aquatic animal species and their viruses. The outcome is a continuous emergence of viral diseases in aquaculture, which may be driven by virus factors, animal host factors, environmental factors, and/or anthropogenic factors. Examples of emerging viruses in aquaculture include viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus, infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus, infectious salmon anaemia virus, piscine orthoreovirus, Tilapia lake virus, Covert mortality nodavirus, Shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus, and Abalone herpesvirus.","['1 Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, 550 University Ave., Charlottetown, P E I C1A 4P3, Canada.

Several computational pipelines capable of identifying and classifying viral sequences in NGS data have been developed and used to search for viruses in human or animal samples, microbiomes, and in various environments. In this review we summarize the different approaches used to determine viral presence in sequence data. Strategies for avoiding confounding factors such as physical contamination and computational artifacts that lead to false virus identification are discussed. The application of these methodologies to cancer data sets has led to important insights on viruses both as drivers of and biomarkers for specific tumors.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA.

However, elucidating the pathological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in humans has been challenging. A comprehensive analysis of the molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and molecular changes in COVID-19 patients may have practical significance in developing assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and formulating clinical treatment strategies against COVID-19. The omics approach for studying biochemical mechanisms can be used to elucidate the molecular characteristics and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. The omics-scale research on COVID-19 has been carried out rapidly, bringing hope for developing a robust diagnostic assay, discovering reliable biomarkers to assess disease progression, and developing therapeutic drugs and vaccines. In this review, we summarize, from an omics perspective, the strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies against the virus, the metabolomic and proteomic changes in COVID-19 patients, and the progress of research on anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with their potential clinical applications.","['1 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']","Baoxu Lin, Jianhua Liu, Yong Liu, Xiaosong Qin, ",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,NO_DATE,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; omics; system biology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33375876
368,The beneficial effects of brown adipose tissue transplantation,"Obesity is a disease that results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential therapeutic target to improve the comorbidities associated with obesity due to its inherent thermogenic capacity and its ability to improve glucose metabolism. Multiple studies have shown that activation of BAT using either pharmacological treatments or cold exposure had an acute effect to increase metabolic function and reduce adiposity. Recent preclinical investigations have explored whether increasing BAT mass or activation through transplantation models could improve glucose metabolism and metabolic health. Successful BAT transplantation models have shown improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, as well as reductions in body mass and decreased adiposity in recipients. BAT transplantation may confer its beneficial effects through several different mechanisms, including endocrine effects via the release of 'batokines'. More recent studies have demonstrated that beige and brown adipocytes isolated from human progenitor cells and transplanted into mouse models result in metabolic improvements similar to transplantation of whole BAT; this could represent a clinically translatable model. In this review we will discuss the impetus for both early and recent investigations utilizing BAT transplantation models, the outcomes of these studies, and review the mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of BAT transplant to confer improvements in metabolic health.","['1 Dorothy M.

369,Role of viruses in gastrointestinal cancer,"Gastrointestinal cancers are a global public health problem, which represent a vast majority of all cancer-caused deaths in both men and women. On the other hand, viral pathogens have been long implicated as etiological factors in the onset of certain human cancers, including gastrointestinal tumors. In this regard, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and John Cunningham Virus (JCV) have been more strongly suggested to be involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis; so that, the association of HPV with oropharyngeal and anal cancers and also the association of EBV with gastric cancer have been etiologically confirmed by epidemiological and experimental investigations. Although, the association of other viruses is less evident, but may rely on co-factors for their oncogenic roles. Therefore, to improve the prevention and treatment of these classes of cancer, their association with viral agents as potential risk factors should be investigated with care. In this respect, the present review has focused on the existing literature on the subject of viral involvement in gastrointestinal tumorgenesis, by covering and discussing various gastrointestinal cancers, corresponding viral agents and their oncogenic aspects and then summarizing evidences either supporting or rejecting a causal role of these pathogens in gastrointestinal malignancies.","['1 Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', '2 Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']","Habibollah Mirzaei, Hossein Goudarzi, Gita Eslami, Ebrahim Faghihloo, ",Journal of cellular physiology,NO_DATE,Epstein-Barr virus; John Cunningham virus; gastrointestinal cancers; human papilloma virus; viral pathogens.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28926109
370,Bat Flies and Their Microparasites: Current Knowledge and Distribution,"Bats are the second most diverse mammalian group, playing keystone roles in ecosystems but also act as reservoir hosts for numerous pathogens. Due to their colonial habits which implies close contacts between individuals, bats are often parasitized by multiple species of micro- and macroparasites. The particular ecology, behavior, and environment of bat species may shape patterns of intra- and interspecific pathogen transmission, as well as the presence of specific vectorial organisms. This review synthetizes information on a multi-level parasitic system: bats, bat flies and their microparasites. Bat flies (Diptera: Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) are obligate, hematophagous ectoparasites of bats consisting of ~500 described species. Diverse parasitic organisms have been detected in bat flies including bacteria, blood parasites, fungi, and viruses, which suggest their vectorial potential. We discuss the ecological epidemiology of microparasites, their potential physiological effects on both bats and bat flies, and potential research perspectives in the domain of bat pathogens. For simplicity, we use the term microparasite throughout this review, yet it remains unclear whether some bacteria are parasites or symbionts of their bat fly hosts.","['1 Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', '2 Museum of Zoology, Lausanne, Switzerland.']","Tamara Szentiványi, Philippe Christe, Olivier Glaizot, ",Frontiers in veterinary science,2019,bat flies; chiroptera; distribution; microparasite; pathogen.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31106212
371,Understanding the Mechanisms Underlying Host Restriction of Insect-Specific Viruses,"Arthropod-borne viruses contribute significantly to global mortality and morbidity in humans and animals. These viruses are mainly transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous arthropod vectors, especially mosquitoes. Recently, there has been substantial attention for a novel group of viruses, referred to as insect-specific viruses (ISVs) which are exclusively maintained in mosquito populations. Recent discoveries of novel insect-specific viruses over the past years generated a great interest not only in their potential use as vaccine and diagnostic platforms but also as novel biological control agents due to their ability to modulate arbovirus transmission. While arboviruses infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, the replication of insect-specific viruses is restricted in vertebrates at multiple stages of virus replication. The vertebrate restriction factors include the genetic elements of ISVs (structural and non-structural genes and the untranslated terminal regions), vertebrate host factors (agonists and antagonists), and the temperature-dependent microenvironment. A better understanding of these bottlenecks is thus warranted. In this review, we explore these factors and the complex interplay between ISVs and their hosts contributing to this host restriction phenomenon.","['1 The Pirbright Institute, Pirbright, Woking GU24 0NF, UK.', '2 KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.']","Ahmed Me Elrefaey, Rana Abdelnabi, Ana Lucia Rosales Rosas, Lanjiao Wang, Sanjay Basu, Leen Delang, ",Viruses,2020,arbovirus; flavivirus; host restriction; insect-specific virus; mosquito; mosquito-specific virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32878245

SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is characterized by symptoms such as fever and dyspnea accompanied by infrequent incidence of lymphopenia, gastrointestinal complications such as elevated hepatic aminotransferases, and diarrhea. Originating in bats, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been transmitted to humans likely via an intermediate host that is yet to be discovered. Owing to the absence of any vaccines or definite anti-viral drugs alongside the greater mobility of people across the globe, international and national efforts in containing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection are experiencing severe difficulties. In this review, we have provided a picture of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological characteristics, the clinical symptoms experienced by patients of varying age groups, the molecular virology of SARS-CoV-2, and the treatment regimens currently employed for fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as their outcomes.","['1 National Brain Research Centre, Manesar, Gurugram, Haryana, India.']","Surajit Chakraborty, Anirban Basu, ",F1000Research,2020,COVID-19; Pandemic; Public health; SARS-CoV-2; Virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32595947

These pathogens are causative agents for acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal disease in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals of all ages globally. Despite virus-virus co-infection events in the intestine being increasingly detected, little is known about their impact on disease outcomes or human health. Here, we review what is currently known about the clinical prevalence of virus-virus co-infections and how co-infections may influence vaccine responses.

375,Non-invasive methods for the assessment of brown adipose tissue in humans,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a recently rediscovered tissue in people that has shown promise as a potential therapeutic target against obesity and its metabolic abnormalities. Reliable non-invasive assessment of BAT volume and activity is critical to allow its importance in metabolic control to be evaluated. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in combination with 2-deoxy-2-[18 F]fluoroglucose administration is currently the most frequently used and most established method for the detection and quantification of activated BAT in humans. However, it involves radiation exposure and can detect activated (e.g. after cold exposure), but not quiescent, BAT. Several alternative methods that overcome some of these limitations have been developed including different PET approaches, single-photon emission imaging, CT, magnetic resonance based approaches, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, near infrared spectroscopy, and temperature assessment of fat depots containing brown adipocytes. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the currently available methods that non-invasively probe various aspects of BAT biology in order to assess BAT volume and/or metabolism. Although several of these methods show promise for the non-invasive assessment of BAT volume and function, further research is needed to optimize them to enable an accurate, reproducible and practical means for the assessment of human BAT content and its metabolic function.","['1 Center for Human Nutrition, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', '2 Harokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', '3 Department of Radiology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', '4 Department of Radiation Oncology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']","Maria Chondronikola, Scott C Beeman, Richard L Wahl, ",The Journal of physiology,2018,PET; brown adipose tissue; imaging; magnetic resonance imaging; metabolism; methods; temperature.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29119565
376,Nanomedicine strategies to target coronavirus,"With the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, the middle east respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the 21st first century has so far faced the outbreak of three major coronaviruses (CoVs). In particular, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly over the globe affecting nearly 25.000.000 people up to date. Recent evidences pointing towards mutations within the viral spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that are considered the cause for this rapid spread and currently around 300 clinical trials are running to find a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nanomedicine, the application of nanocarriers to deliver drugs specifically to a target sites, has been applied for different diseases, such as cancer but also in viral infections. Nanocarriers can be designed to encapsulate vaccines and deliver them towards antigen presenting cells or function as antigen-presenting carriers themselves. Furthermore, drugs can be encapsulated into such carriers to directly target them to infected cells. In particular, virus-mimicking nanoparticles (NPs) such as self-assembled viral proteins, virus-like particles or liposomes, are able to replicate the infection mechanism and can not only be used as delivery system but also to study viral infections and related mechanisms. This review will provide a detailed description of the composition and replication strategy of CoVs, an overview of the therapeutics currently evaluated in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2 and will discuss the potential of NP-based vaccines, targeted delivery of therapeutics using nanocarriers as well as using NPs to further investigate underlying biological processes in greater detail.","['1 Department of Biomaterials Science and Technology, Section Targeted Therapeutics, Technical Medical Centre, University of Twente, 7500AE, Enschede, the Netherlands.', '2 Artemis One Health Research Institute, 2629JD, Delft, the Netherlands.']","Marcel Alexander Heinrich, Byron Martina, Jai Prakash, ",Nano today,NO_DATE,Coronavirus; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticle-based vaccine; Nasal drug delivery; SARS-CoV-2; Virus-mimicking nanoparticles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32904707
377,The zoonotic potential of bat-borne coronaviruses,"Seven zoonoses - human infections of animal origin - have emerged from the Coronaviridae family in the past century, including three viruses responsible for significant human mortality (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) in the past twenty years alone. These three viruses, in addition to two older CoV zoonoses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) are believed to be originally derived from wild bat reservoir species. We review the molecular biology of the bat-derived Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera, highlighting features that contribute to their potential for cross-species emergence, including the use of well-conserved mammalian host cell machinery for cell entry and a unique capacity for adaptation to novel host environments after host switching. The adaptive capacity of coronaviruses largely results from their large genomes, which reduce the risk of deleterious mutational errors and facilitate range-expanding recombination events by offering heightened redundancy in essential genetic material. Large CoV genomes are made possible by the unique proofreading capacity encoded for their RNA-dependent polymerase. We find that bat-borne SARS-related coronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, the source clade for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, present a particularly poignant pandemic threat, due to the extraordinary viral genetic diversity represented among several sympatric species of their horseshoe bat hosts. To date, Sarbecovirus surveillance has been almost entirely restricted to China. More vigorous field research efforts tracking the circulation of Sarbecoviruses specifically and Betacoronaviruses more generally is needed across a broader global range if we are to avoid future repeats of the COVID-19 pandemic.","['1 Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, University of Antananarivo, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', '2 Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, U.S.A.', '3 Department of Entomology, University of Antananarivo, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', '4 Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, U.S.A.', '5 Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, Antananarivo, Madagascar.']","Ny Anjara Fifi Ravelomanantsoa, Sarah Guth, Angelo Andrianiaina, Santino Andry, Anecia Gentles, Hafaliana Christian Ranaivoson, Cara E Brook, ",Emerging topics in life sciences,2020,SARS-CoV-2; bat; coronavirus; zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258903

In this work, Heterobasidion parviporum strains hosting five coinfecting viruses simultaneously were constructed and used as donors in transmission experiments. They showed that viruses move more frequently between the mycelia of the same species than between the mycelia of H. parviporum and Heterobasidionannosum. One of the strains was used to show that coinfection of five viruses is relatively unstable in a natural environment and analyses of the growth rate and competitive ability of Heterobasidion strains hosting various virus combinations revealed that viral effects are not additive. The results also supported the view that the transmission of the promising virocontrol agent HetPV13-an1 may be enhanced by coinfecting viruses in the donor mycelium. However, its detrimental effects may be blocked by the presence of other viruses in the same mycelium.

      In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection broke out in Wuhan, China. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of this emerging virus. In this manuscript, we collected relevant articles and reviewed the characteristics about SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods:
        
      
      We performed an online search on PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords COVID-19, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-2, and summarized the epidemiology, virology, clinical features and treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results:
        
      
      We retrieved 157 published papers about SARS-CoV-2 from January, 2020 to April, 2020. We found that SARS-CoV-2 was a kind of virus with low mortality rate and high infectivity. This virus can enter human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in alveoli and activate immune response in human body. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified as asymptomatic, mild, common, severe, and critical. We summarized antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir.

Although phylogenetic analyses have indicated ancient origin of human coronaviruses from animal relatives, their evolutionary history remains to be established. Using phylogenetics and ""high order genomic structures"" including trimer spectrums, codon usage and dinucleotide suppression, we observed distinct clustering of all human coronaviruses that formed phylogenetic clades with their closest animal relatives, indicating they have encompassed long evolutionary histories within specific ecological niches before jumping species barrier to infect humans. The close relationships between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 imply similar evolutionary origin. However, a lower Effective Codon Number (ENC) pattern and CpG dinucleotide suppression in SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may imply a better host fitness, and thus their success in sustaining a pandemic. Characterization of coronavirus heterogeneity via complementary approaches enriches our understanding on the evolution and virus-host interaction of these emerging human pathogens while the underlying mechanistic basis in pathogenicity warrants further investigation.","['1 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

381,Molecular interactions of plant viral satellites,"Plant viral satellites fall under the category of subviral agents. Their genomes are composed of small RNA or DNA molecules a few hundred nucleotides in length and contain an assortment of highly complex and overlapping functions. Each lacks the ability to either replicate or undergo encapsidation or both in the absence of a helper virus (HV). As the number of known satellites increases steadily, our knowledge regarding their sequence conservation strategies, means of replication and specific interactions with host and helper viruses is improving. This review demonstrates that the molecular interactions of these satellites are unique and highly complex, largely influenced by the highly specific host plants and helper viruses that they associate with. Circularized forms of single-stranded RNA are of particular interest, as they have recently been found to play a variety of novel cellular functions. Linear forms of satRNA are also of great significance as they may complement the helper virus genome in exacerbating symptoms, or in certain instances, actively compete against it, thus reducing symptom severity. This review serves to describe the current literature with respect to these molecular mechanisms in detail as well as to discuss recent insights into this emerging field in terms of evolution, classification and symptom development.

We provide a perspective on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-derived nAbs, comparing these with existing SARS-CoV-derived antibodies. We offer insight into how these antibodies cross-react and cross-neutralize by analyzing available structures of spike (S) glycoprotein-antibody complexes. We also propose ways of adopting antibody-based strategies - such as cocktail antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 - to overcome the possible resistance of currently identified mutants and mitigate possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) pathologies. This review provides a platform for the progression of antibody and vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2, and possibly against future coronavirus pandemics.","['1 Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 14 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543.', '2 Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 14 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543.

383,"Econutrition, brown and beige fat tissue and obesity","Background and objectives:
        
      
      Obesity is caused by excessive fat accumulation or abnormal fat distribution and has become one of the biggest health challenges worldwide. Considering the high thermogenic ability of brown fat tissue (BAT) and the plasticity of fat tissue, to induce the browning of white fat tissue (WAT), so increasing BAT activity provides an attractive option for the prevention and resolution of obesity. The aim of the present narrative review was to understand the relationship between diet, BAT, and obesity. Methods and study design:
        
      
      PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Results:
        
      
      Although cold exposure has long been known to be effective in the browning of WAT and activation of BAT, it is societally impractical for everyday body weight management aside from the tolerance of ambient temperature. An alternative is to identify specific dietary components with similar effects to cold exposure on BAT. Current evidence indicates that capsaicin and capsinoids, catechins, curcumin, quercetin, berberine, lipoic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids, royal jelly, and some natural sweeteners are effective promoters of WAT browning, increase BAT activity and improve obesity related traits. However, only capsaicin, capsinoids, and catechins have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. Evidence for effects of curcumin, quercetin, berberine, lipoic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids, royal jelly and natural sweeteners on BAT have only been observed in animal or in vitro studies, with clinical trials awaited for verification. Conclusions:
        
      
      Several dietary components can induce WAT browning and activate BAT, offering potential targets for obesity prevention and management.","['1 Institute of Nutrition and Health, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', '2 Monash Asia Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', '3 China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', '4 National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.', '5 Institute of Nutrition and Health, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.

384,Chasing Intracellular Zika Virus Using Proteomics,"Flaviviruses are the most medically relevant group of arboviruses causing a wide range of diseases in humans and are associated with high mortality and morbidity, as such posing a major health concern. Viruses belonging to this family can be endemic (e.g., dengue virus), but can also cause fulminant outbreaks (e.g., West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Zika virus). Intense research efforts in the past decades uncovered shared fundamental strategies used by flaviviruses to successfully replicate in their respective hosts. However, the distinct features contributing to the specific host and tissue tropism as well as the pathological outcomes unique to each individual flavivirus are still largely elusive. The profound footprint of individual viruses on their respective hosts can be investigated using novel technologies in the field of proteomics that have rapidly developed over the last decade. An unprecedented sensitivity and throughput of mass spectrometers, combined with the development of new sample preparation and bioinformatics analysis methods, have made the systematic investigation of virus-host interactions possible. Furthermore, the ability to assess dynamic alterations in protein abundances, protein turnover rates and post-translational modifications occurring in infected cells now offer the unique possibility to unravel complex viral perturbations induced in the infected host. In this review, we discuss the most recent contributions of mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches in flavivirus biology with a special focus on Zika virus, and their basic and translational potential and implications in understanding and characterizing host responses to arboviral infections.","['1 School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Schneckenburgerstr. 8, 81675 Munich, Germany. pietro.scaturro@tum.de.', '2 School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Schneckenburgerstr. 8, 81675 Munich, Germany. lena.kastner@tum.de.', '3 School of Medicine, Institute of Virology, Technical University of Munich, Schneckenburgerstr. 8, 81675 Munich, Germany. andreas.pichlmair@tum.de.', '4 German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Munich Partner Site, 81675 Munich, Germany. andreas.pichlmair@tum.de.']","Pietro Scaturro, Anna Lena Kastner, Andreas Pichlmair, ",Viruses,2019,AP-LC-MS/MS; DENV; Label-free Quatification; WNV; Zika virus; arboviruses; flaviviruses; interactome; phosphoproteomics; proteomics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31546825
385,Nature's fat-burning machine: brown adipose tissue in a hibernating mammal,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a unique thermogenic tissue in mammals that rapidly produces heat via nonshivering thermogenesis. Small mammalian hibernators have evolved the greatest capacity for BAT because they use it to rewarm from hypothermic torpor numerous times throughout the hibernation season. Although hibernator BAT physiology has been investigated for decades, recent efforts have been directed toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of BAT regulation and function using a variety of methods, from mitochondrial functional assays to 'omics' approaches. As a result, the inner-workings of hibernator BAT are now being illuminated. In this Review, we discuss recent research progress that has identified players and pathways involved in brown adipocyte differentiation and maturation, as well as those involved in metabolic regulation. The unique phenotype of hibernation, and its reliance on BAT to generate heat to arouse mammals from torpor, has uncovered new molecular mechanisms and potential strategies for biomedical applications.","['1 Department of Integrative Biology and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA matt.andrews@orgeonstate.edu.']","Mallory A Ballinger, Matthew T Andrews, ",The Journal of experimental biology,2018,Brown adipose tissue; Gene expression; Hibernation; Mitochondria; Thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514878

387,MASS SPECTROMETRY IN VIROLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Virology, as a branch of the life sciences, discovered mass spectrometry (MS) to be the pivotal tool around two decades ago. The technique unveiled the complex network of interactions between the living world of pro- and eukaryotes and viruses, which delivered ""a piece of bad news wrapped in protein"" as defined by Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize Laureate, in 1960. However, MS is constantly evolving, and novel approaches allow for a better understanding of interactions in this micro- and nanoworld. Currently, we can investigate the interplay between the virus and the cell by analyzing proteomes, interactomes, virus-cell interactions, and search for the compounds that build viral structures. In addition, by using MS, it is possible to look at the cell from the broader perspective and determine the role of viral infection on the scale of the organism, for example, monitoring the crosstalk between infected tissues and the immune system. In such a way, MS became one of the major tools for the modern virology, allowing us to see the infection in the context of the whole cell or the organism. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

388,A nidovirus perspective on SARS-CoV-2,"Two pandemics of respiratory distress diseases associated with zoonotic introductions of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in the human population during 21st century raised unprecedented interest in coronavirus research and assigned it unseen urgency. The two viruses responsible for the outbreaks, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are in the spotlight, and SARS-CoV-2 is the focus of the current fast-paced research. Its foundation was laid down by studies of many corona- and related viruses that collectively form the vast order Nidovirales. Comparative genomics of nidoviruses played a key role in this advancement over more than 30 years. It facilitated the transfer of knowledge from characterized to newly identified viruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as contributed to the dissection of the nidovirus proteome and identification of patterns of variations between different taxonomic groups, from species to families. This review revisits selected cases of protein conservation and variation that define nidoviruses, illustrates the remarkable plasticity of the proteome during nidovirus adaptation, and asks questions at the interface of the proteome and processes that are vital for nidovirus reproduction and could inform the ongoing research of SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC, Leiden, the Netherlands.', '2 Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC, Leiden, the Netherlands; Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, 119899, Moscow, Russia.

389,Relation of diet-induced thermogenesis to brown adipose tissue activity in healthy men,"Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic tissue activated by the sympathetic nervous system in response to cold exposure. It contributes to energy expenditure (EE) and takes up glucose and lipids from the circulation. Studies in rodents suggest that BAT contributes to the transient rise in EE after food intake, so-called diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). We investigated the relationship between human BAT activity and DIT in response to glucose intake in 17 healthy volunteers. We assessed DIT, cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT), and maximum BAT activity at three separate study visits within 2 wk. DIT was measured by indirect calorimetry during an oral glucose tolerance test. CIT was assessed as the difference in EE after cold exposure of 2-h duration as compared with warm conditions. Maximal activity of BAT was assessed by 18-F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) 18F-FDG-PET/MRI after cold exposure and concomitant pharmacological stimulation with mirabegron. Seventeen healthy men (mean age = 23.4 yr, mean body mass index = 23.2 kg/m2) participated in the study. EE increased from 1,908 (±181) kcal/24 h to 2,128 (±277) kcal/24 h (P < 0.0001, +11.5%) after mild cold exposure. An oral glucose load increased EE from 1,911 (±165) kcal/24 h to 2,096 (±167) kcal/24 h at 60 min (P < 0.0001, +9.7%). The increase in EE in response to cold was significantly associated with BAT activity (R2 = 0.43, P = 0.004). However, DIT was not associated with BAT activity (R2 = 0.015, P = 0.64). DIT after an oral glucose load was not associated with stimulated 18F-FDG uptake into BAT, suggesting that DIT is independent from BAT activity in humans (Clinicaltrials.gov Registration No. NCT03189511).NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) was related to BAT activity as determined by FDG-PET/MRI after stimulation of BAT. Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was not related to stimulated BAT activity. Supraclavicular skin temperature was related to CIT but not to DIT. DIT in humans is probably not a function of BAT.","['1 Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', '2 Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Zurich/University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '3 Institute of Food, Nutrition, and Health, ETH Zurich, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland.']","Rahel Catherina Loeliger, Claudia Irene Maushart, Gani Gashi, Jaël Rut Senn, Martina Felder, Anton S Becker, Julian Müller, Miroslav Balaz, Christian Wolfrum, Irene A Burger, Matthias Johannes Betz, ",American journal of physiology.

The family includes the genus, Finnlakevirus, with the species, Flavobacterium virus FLiP. Flavobacterium phage FLiP was isolated with its Gram-negative host bacterium from a boreal freshwater habitat in Central Finland in 2010. It is the first described single-stranded DNA virus with an internal membrane and shares minimal sequence similarity with other known viruses. The virion organization (pseudo T=21 dextro) and major capsid protein fold (double-β-barrel) resemble those of Pseudoalteromonas phage PM2 (family Corticoviridae), which has a double-stranded DNA genome. A similar major capsid protein fold is also found in other double-stranded DNA viruses in the kingdom Bamfordvirae.

391,Drawing Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and the Animal Coronaviruses,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, has infected 46,182 million people, resulting in 1,197,026 deaths (as of 1 November 2020), with devastating and far-reaching impacts on economies and societies worldwide. The complex origin, extended human-to-human transmission, pathogenesis, host immune responses, and various clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 have presented serious challenges in understanding and combating the pandemic situation. Human CoVs gained attention only after the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002-2003. On the other hand, animal CoVs have been studied extensively for many decades, providing a plethora of important information on their genetic diversity, transmission, tissue tropism and pathology, host immunity, and therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, some of which have striking resemblance to those seen with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the evolution of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, is intermingled with those of animal CoVs. In this comprehensive review, attempts have been made to compare the current knowledge on evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, immunopathology, therapeutics, and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 with those of various animal CoVs.

      This study aimed to quantify and compare the amount, activity, and anatomical distribution of cold-activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) in healthy, young, lean women and men. Methods:
        
      
      BAT volume and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake were measured by positron emission tomography and computerized tomography in 12 women and 12 men (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2 , aged 18-35 years) after 5 hours of exposure to their coldest temperature before overt shivering. Results:
        
      
      Women had a lower detectable BAT volume than men (P = 0.03), but there was no difference after normalizing to body size. The mean BAT glucose uptake and relative distribution of BAT did not differ by sex. 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake consistent with BAT was observed in superficial dorsocervical adipose tissue of 6 of 12 women but only 1 of 12 men (P = 0.02). This potential BAT depot would pose fewer biopsy risks than other depots. Conclusions:
        
      
      Despite differences in adiposity and total BAT volume, we found that healthy, lean, young women and men do not differ in the relative amount, glucose uptake, and distribution of BAT. Dorsocervical 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was more prevalent in women and may be a remnant of interscapular BAT seen in human newborns.

393,A high-throughput drug screening strategy against coronaviruses,"The emergence and re-emergence of coronaviruses (CoV) continually cause circulating epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","[""1 Central Laboratory, Longgang Distract People's Hospital of Shenzhen & The Third Affiliated Hospital (Provisional) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China."", ""2 Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""3 Department of Emergency, People's Hospital of Leling, Dezhou, Shandong, China."", '4 Department of Medical Cell Biology and Genetics, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Genome Stability & Disease Prevention, Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Anti-ageing and Regenerative Medicine, Health Science Center, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', '5 Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '6 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250100, Shandong, China.

These include CoVs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and severe acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease. These observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs. In this review, we follow the CoV outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats. We review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor CoVs without severe disease. We speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and factors that enable these viruses to ""jump"" from bats to other mammals. We hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations.","['1 Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Michael DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada. banera9@mcmaster.ca.', '2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.

395,Insights into brown adipose tissue evolution and function from non-model organisms,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) enables adaptive thermoregulation through heat production that is catalyzed by mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). BAT is frequently studied in rodent model organisms, and recently in adult humans to treat metabolic diseases. However, complementary studies of many non-model species, which have diversified to many more ecological niches, may significantly broaden our understanding of BAT regulation and its physiological roles. This Review highlights the research on non-model organisms, which was instrumental to the discovery of BAT function, and the unique evolutionary history of BAT/UCP1 in mammalian thermogenesis. The comparative biology of BAT provides a powerful integrative approach that could identify conserved and specialized functional changes in BAT and UCP1 by considering species diversity, ecology and evolution, and by fusing multiple scientific disciplines such as physiology and biochemistry. Thus, resolving the complete picture of BAT biology may fail if comparative studies of non-model organisms are neglected.","['1 Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center at Helmholtz Zentrum München, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany martin.jastroch@helmholtz-muenchen.de.', '2 German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.', '3 Department of Animal Physiology, Faculty of Biology, Philipps University of Marburg, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.', '4 Department of Molecular Endocrinology, Center of Brain, Behavior and Metabolism (CBBM), University of Lübeck, D-23562 Lübeck, Germany.', '5 Institute for Diabetes and Obesity, Helmholtz Diabetes Center at Helmholtz Zentrum München, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.']","Martin Jastroch, Rebecca Oelkrug, Susanne Keipert, ",The Journal of experimental biology,2018,Beige adipose tissue; Endothermy; Marsupials; Metabolic disease; Thermogenesis; Uncoupling protein.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514888

397,Electrical Neurostimulation Promotes Brown Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis,"Background:
        
      
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is present in humans and rodents, and contributes to energy expenditure by converting energy stored in lipids and glucose into heat. Beta adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonists have been proposed as pharmacological tools to activate BAT, but they lack selectivity for this tissue. This study aimed to investigate the possibility to apply electrical neurostimulation as a novel approach to activate BAT by promoting the sympathetic outflow towards BAT. Methods:
        
      
      Male C57BL/6J mice were treated with either unilateral electrical neurostimulation of interscapular BAT or with the β3-AR agonist CL316,243. Thermogenesis, nutrient uptake by BAT and downstream signaling of adrenergic receptors in BAT were examined. Results:
        
      
      Electrical neurostimulation and β3-AR agonism acutely increased heat production by BAT, as evidenced by an increase in local temperature in BAT, without influencing the core body temperature. Both treatments acutely increased tyrosine hydroxylase content in the nerve terminals thereby confirming enhanced sympathetic activity. In addition, we identified increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase coinciding with reduced intracellular lipids in BAT, without affecting acute nutrient uptake from plasma. The increased BAT temperature as induced by electrical neurostimulation was reversed by β3-AR antagonism. Conclusion:
        
      
      Electrical neurostimulation acutely promotes thermogenesis in BAT as dependent on β3-AR signaling. We anticipate that electrical neurostimulation may be further developed as a novel strategy to activate BAT and thereby combat (cardio)metabolic diseases.","['1 Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', '2 Einthoven Laboratory for Experimental Vascular Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', '3 Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal Research, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', '4 Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', ""5 Department of Endocrinology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]","Zhuang Li, Wouter J de Jonge, Yanan Wang, Patrick C N Rensen, Sander Kooijman, ",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020,beta-3 adrenergic receptor signaling; brown adipose tissue; brown adipose tissue temperature; neurostimulation; thermogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33101199

In humans, CoVs can cause respiratory, kidney, heart, brain, and intestinal infections that can range from mild to lethal. Since the start of the 21st century, three β-coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier to infect humans: severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). These viruses are dangerous and can easily be transmitted from human to human. Therefore, the development of anticoronaviral therapies is urgently needed. However, to date, no approved vaccines or drugs against CoV infections are available. In this review, we focus on the medicinal chemistry efforts toward the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, targeting biochemical events important for viral replication and its life cycle. These targets include the spike glycoprotein and its host-receptors for viral entry, proteases that are essential for cleaving polyproteins to produce functional proteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for viral RNA replication.","['1 PharmaCenter Bonn, Pharmaceutical Institute, Pharmaceutical & Medicinal Chemistry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', '2 Department of Chemistry, PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Sethu Institute of Technology, Virudhunagar, Tamilnadu, India.']","Thanigaimalai Pillaiyar, Lukas L Wendt, Manoj Manickam, Maheswaran Easwaran, ",Medicinal research reviews,NO_DATE,COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV-1; SARS-CoV-2; antivirals; human coronavirus; main protease inhibitors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32852058

There are seven known human CoVs, each of which causes respiratory diseases: together account for about one third of common colds. Some CoVs have recently entered humans from infected animals and lastly we have SARS COVID-19, (CoV), which causes severe acute, often fatal respiratory syndromes. The prevalence of CoV, the easy zoonotic transmission and the potential to cause serious respiratory diseases, lead to urgent research to discover the mechanisms of CoV infection.

A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from lower respiratory tract sample as the causative agent. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 rapidly spread into at least 114 countries and killed more than 4,000 people by March 11 2020. WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There have been 2 novel coronavirus outbreaks in the past 2 decades. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 caused by SARS-CoV had a case fatality rate of around 10% (8,098 confirmed cases and 774 deaths), while Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERSCoV killed 861 people out of a total 2,502 confirmed cases between 2012 and 2019.

As with many infectious diseases, the immune response to coronavirus infection may act as a double-edged sword: necessary for promoting antiviral host defense, but, if not appropriately regulated, also able to incite life-threatening immunopathology. Key immunoregulatory mediators include the chemokines, a large family of leukocyte chemoattractants that coordinate leukocyte infiltration, positioning and activation in infected tissue by acting at specific G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we compare the involvement of chemokines and chemokine receptors during infection with the three epidemic coronaviruses and discuss their potential value as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic development.","['1 Molecular Signaling Section, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States.']","Shamik Majumdar, Philip M Murphy, ",Frontiers in pharmacology,2021,COVID-19; MERS; MERS-CoV; SARS; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33613280

To establish a safe and convenient assay system for studying entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we constructed a codon-optimized, full-length C-terminal mutant spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2. We generated a luciferase (Luc)-expressing pseudovirus containing the wild-type or mutant S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the envelope-defective HIV-1 backbone. The key parameters for this pseudovirus-based assay, including the S mutants and virus incubation time, were optimized. This pseudovirus contains a Luc reporter gene that enabled us to easily quantify virus entry into angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing 293T cells. Cathepsin (Cat)B/L inhibitor E-64d could significantly block SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in 293T-ACE2 cells. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus could be neutralized by sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients or recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc region of human IgG1. Thus, we developed a pseudovirus-based assay for SARS-CoV-2, which will be valuable for evaluating viral entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against this highly pathogenic virus.","['1 Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases (Ministry of Education), Institute for Viral Hepatitis, Department of Infectious Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, China.']","Jie Hu, Qingzhu Gao, Changlong He, Ailong Huang, Ni Tang, Kai Wang, ",Genes & diseases,NO_DATE,Antiviral therapeutics; Coronavirus; Neutralizing antibodies; Pseudovirus; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32837985

The main complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is respiratory failure, but several patients have also been admitted to the hospital with neurological symptoms. Direct invasion, hematogenic rout, retrograde and anterograde transport along peripheral nerves are considered as main neuroinvasion mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2.

411,Immunotherapy approaches on innate immunity for SARS-Cov-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused fatal outbreaks of pneumonia. The similarity of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and RaTG13 is about 76% and 97%, respectively. Also its potential receptor-binding domain (RBD) shows similarity with approximately 74% and 90.1% for SARS-CoV and RaTG13, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Sialic acids are primarily expressed by vertebrates and some microbial pathogens improving the ability to avoid immune system of vertebrate host. Interactions of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins (Siglecs) with their ligands play an important role in modulating immune cell function activities as their regulators. Therefore, while Siglecs help immune cells to distinguish between self and non-self, non-self ligands of some sialylated pathogens can recognize Siglecs and reduce immune cell responses or escape from immune surveillance. In this review, innate immunity in SARS-Cov-2 infection was discussed through Siglecs, especially Siglec-7, Siglec-3, NKG2A and neuraminidases.

412,Analysis of variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome,"Objective:
        
      
      To analyze the evolution and variation of SARS-CoV-2 during the epidemic starting at the end of 2019. Methods:
        
      
      We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI. Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution. Results:
        
      
      The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of β Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days). No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV. The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic. Conclusions:
        
      
      SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus. This finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus.","['1 Biosafety Level-3 Laboratory, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']","Yezhen Zhou, Shihao Zhang, Jiayi Chen, Chengsong Wan, Wei Zhao, Bao Zhang, ",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,2020,SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; evolution; mutation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32376535
413,New approaches targeting brown adipose tissue transplantation as a therapy in obesity,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is raising high expectations as a potential target in the fight against metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. BAT utilizes fuels such as fatty acids to maintain body temperature by uncoupling mitochondrial electron transport to produce heat instead of ATP. This process is called thermogenesis. BAT was considered to be exclusive to rodents and human neonates. However, in the last decade several studies have demonstrated that BAT is not only present but also active in adult humans and that its activity is reduced in several pathological conditions, such as aging, obesity, and diabetes. Thus, tremendous efforts are being made by the scientific community to enhance either BAT mass or activity. Several activators of thermogenesis have been described, such as natriuretic peptides, bone morphogenic proteins, or fibroblast growth factor 21. Furthermore, recent studies have tested a therapeutic approach to directly increase BAT mass by the implantation of either adipocytes or fat tissue. This approach might have an important future in regenerative medicine and in the fight against metabolic disorders. Here, we review the emerging field of BAT transplantation including the various sources of mesenchymal stem cell isolation in rodents and humans and the described metabolic outcomes of adipocyte cell transplantation and BAT transplantation in obesity.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, Institut de Biomedicina de la Universitat de Barcelona (IBUB), Universitat de Barcelona, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, Institut de Biomedicina de la Universitat de Barcelona (IBUB), Universitat de Barcelona, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y la Nutrición (CIBEROBN), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.', '3 Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, Institut de Biomedicina de la Universitat de Barcelona (IBUB), Universitat de Barcelona, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y la Nutrición (CIBEROBN), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.

Mammalian CoVs including COVID-19 (now officially named SARS-CoV-2) belong to either the Alphacoronavirus or Betacoronavirus genera. In birds, the majority of the known CoVs belong to the Gammacoronavirus genus, whilst a small number are classified as Deltacoronaviruses. Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, the recombination of an alpha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely. For recombination to happen, the two viruses would need to be present in the same cell of the same animal at the same time, a highly unlikely scenario as they cannot replicate in the same host!","['1 Royal GD, Deventer, the Netherlands.', '2 Department of Farm Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', '3 Huntingdon, UK.']","J J Sjaak de Wit, Jane K A Cook, ",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,NO_DATE,Avian coronaviruses; COVID-19; mammalian coronaviruses; poultry; wild birds.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32374218

We analyzed 235 datasets of lymphoma patients with two PET/CT examinations at different time points retrospectively. We assessed the anthropometric characteristics, features related to the metabolic syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, season of the PET/CT examination, weight change, prior cancer history, lymphoma subgroups, disease activity, and specific lymphoma-related therapies, and evaluated their association with BAT activity. We found BAT activity in 12% of all examinations, and the incidence of BAT activity after initially negative examinations was 10%. In multivariate regression analysis, the prevalence of BAT activity was associated with age, body mass index, sex, the season of the examination, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and medication on the beta-receptors. New BAT activity arose more often in patients without preceding lymphoma-related therapy. No specific medication was associated with BAT activity. In conclusion, this study confirms the potential connection of BAT with the metabolic syndrome. Preceding lymphoma-related therapy might have an inhibitory effect on the recruitment of BAT.","['1 Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Eberhard Karls University, Hoppe-Seyler-Straße 3, 72076, Tübingen, Germany. cornelia.brendle@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', '2 Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Internal Medicine, Eberhard Karls University, Otfried-Mueller-Straße 10, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.', '3 Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, Eberhard Karls University, Hoppe-Seyler-Straße 3, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.', '4 Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Department of Radiology, Eberhard Karls University, Hoppe-Seyler-Straße 3, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.', '5 Oncology, Hematology, Clinical Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmology, Department of Internal Medicine, Eberhard Karls University, Otfried-Mueller-Straße 10, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.', '6 Nuclear Medicine and Clinical Molecular Imaging, Department of Radiology, Eberhard Karls University, Otfried-Mueller-Straße 14, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.', '7 Cluster of Excellence iFIT (EXC 2180) ""Image Guided and Functionally Instructed Tumor Therapies"", University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '8 German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site, Tübingen, Germany.']","Cornelia Brendle, Norbert Stefan, Eva Grams, Martin Soekler, Christian la Fougère, Christina Pfannenberg, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33311572
422,Vigilance on New-Onset Atherosclerosis Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global challenge to public health. While its typical clinical manifestations are respiratory disorders, emerging evidence of cardiovascular complications indicates the adverse interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular outcomes. Given that viral infection has emerged as an additional risk factor for atherosclerosis, in this paper, we attempt to clarify the susceptibility to new-onset atherosclerosis in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, serving as functional receptors for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells (ECs) directly, leading to endothelial dysfunction and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, high expression of CD147, an alternative receptor, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may also contribute to atherosclerosis in the context of COVID-19. More importantly, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the immune system, which results in excessive inflammation and perpetuates a vicious cycle of deteriorated endothelial dysfunction that further promotes inflammation. The alterations in the blood lipid profile induced by COVID-19 should not be ignored in assessing the predisposition toward atherosclerosis in victims of COVID-19. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the long-term monitoring of inflammatory factors and endothelial function should be considered in the follow-up of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 for early detection and prevention of atherosclerosis.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China.']","Ya Liu, Hai-Gang Zhang, ",Frontiers in medicine,2021,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; atherosclerosis; endothelial dysfunction; inflammation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33553222
423,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"The present study provides an overview of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak which has rapidly extended globally within a short period. COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2). SARS-CoV-2 is different from usual coronaviruses responsible for mild sickness such as common cold among human beings. It is crucial to understand the impact and outcome of this pandemic. We therefore overview the changes in the curves of COVID-19 confirmed cases and fatality rate in China and outside of China from 31st of December 2019 to 25th of March 2020. We also aimed to assess the temporal developments and death rate of COVID-19 in China and worldwide. More than 414,179 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 197 countries, including 81,848 cases in China and 332,331 outside of China. Furthermore, 18,440 infected patients died from COVID-19 infection; 3,287 cases were from China and 15,153 fatalities were reported worldwide. Among the worldwide infected cases, 113,802 patients have been recovered and discharged from different hospitals. Effective prevention and control measures should be taken to control the disease. The presented Chinese model (protocol) of disease prevention and control could be utilized in order to curb the pandemic situation.","['1 Department of Public Health Laboratory Sciences, West China School of Public Health (No.4 West China Teaching Hospital), Sichuan University.', '2 School of Chemical Engineering Pharmaceutical Engineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering.']","Saira Baloch, Mohsin Ali Baloch, Tianli Zheng, Xiaofang Pei, ",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,NO_DATE,COVID-19; China; coronavirus; pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32321874
424,Antivirals in medical biodefense,"The viruses historically implicated or currently considered as candidates for misuse in bioterrorist events are poxviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses and a number of arboviruses causing encephalitis, including alpha- and flaviviruses. All these viruses are of concern for public health services when they occur in natural outbreaks or emerge in unvaccinated populations. Recent events and intelligence reports point to a growing risk of dangerous biological agents being used for nefarious purposes. Public health responses effective in natural outbreaks of infectious disease may not be sufficient to deal with the severe consequences of a deliberate release of such agents. One important aspect of countermeasures against viral biothreat agents are the antiviral treatment options available for use in post-exposure prophylaxis. These issues were adressed by the organizers of the 16th Medical Biodefense Conference, held in Munich in 2018, in a special session on the development of drugs to treat infections with viruses currently perceived as a threat to societies or associated with a potential for misuse as biothreat agents. This review will outline the state-of-the-art methods in antivirals research discussed and provide an overview of antiviral compounds in the pipeline that are already approved for use or still under development.","['1 Bundeswehr Institute for Microbiology, Neuherbergstraße 11, 80937, Munich, Germany.

BAT that had been know to exist only in mammals and the human neonate has received great attention for the treatment of obesity and diabetes due to its important function in energy metabolism, ever since it is recently reported that human adults have functional BAT. In addition, beige adipocytes, brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), have also been shown to take part in whole body metabolism. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrated that transplantation or activation of BAT or/and beige adipocytes reversed obesity and improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, many genes involved in BATactivation and/or the recruitment of beige cells have been found, thereby providing new promising strategies for future clinical application of BAT activation to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. This review focuses on recent advances of BAT function in the metabolic aspect and the relationship between BAT and cancer cachexia, a pathological process accompanied with decreased body weight and increased energy expenditure in cancer patients. The underlying possible mechanisms to reduce BAT mass and its activity in the elderly are also discussed.","['1 Key Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', '2 The University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', '3 Department of Sports Medicine, College of Health Science, Cheongju University, Cheongju, 363-764, Republic of Korea.', '4 Key Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China. leehj@ioz.ac.cn.', '5 Center for Vascular Research, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea. leehj@ioz.ac.cn.']","Meng Dong, Jun Lin, Wonchung Lim, Wanzhu Jin, Hyuek Jong Lee, ",Frontiers of medicine,NO_DATE,aging; anti-diabetes; anti-obesity; beige adipocyte; brown adipose tissue; cancer cachexia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29119382

Infections with other respiratory pathogens, which on their own produce at least some SARS-CoV-2 symptoms including mortality, were present in both SARS-CoV-2 + and SARS-CoV-2- subjects. Non-SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 + (86%) patients than SARS-CoV-2- patients (76%) (p < 0.0001). Among the co-pathogens present in both subject groups were K. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis which can produce serious respiratory illness on their own, Advanced age and nursing home status were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 + and co-infection rates.

430,A Feedforward Loop within the Thyroid-Brown Fat Axis Facilitates Thermoregulation,"Thyroid hormones (TH) control brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and differentiation, but their subsequent homeostatic response following BAT activation remains obscure. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cold- and capsinoids-induced BAT activation and TH changes between baseline and 2 hours post-intervention. Nineteen healthy subjects underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) and whole-body calorimetry (WBC) after 2 hours of cold exposure (~14.5 °C) or capsinoids ingestion (12 mg) in a crossover design. Standardized uptake values (SUV-mean) of the region of interest and energy expenditure (EE) were measured. Plasma free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured before and 2 hours after each intervention. Subjects were divided into groups based on the presence (n = 12) or absence (n = 7) of BAT after cold exposure. 12 of 19 subjects were classified as BAT-positive. Subjects with BAT had higher baseline FT3 concentration, baseline FT3/FT4 ratio compared with subjects without BAT. Controlling for body fat percentage, FT3 concentration at baseline was associated with EE change from baseline after cold exposure (P = 0.037) and capsinoids (P = 0.047). Plasma FT4 level significantly increased associated with reciprocal decline in TSH after acute cold exposure and capsinoids independently of subject and treatment status. Circulating FT3 was higher in BAT-positive subjects and was a stronger predictor of EE changes after cold exposure and capsinoids in healthy humans. BAT activation elevates plasma FT4 acutely and may contribute towards augmentation of thermogenesis via a positive feedback response.","['1 Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore.', '2 Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore.', '3 Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '4 Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, Singapore.', '5 Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore. melvin_leow@sics.a-star.edu.sg.', '6 Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore. melvin_leow@sics.a-star.edu.sg.', '7 Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, Singapore. melvin_leow@sics.a-star.edu.sg.', '8 Department of Endocrinology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), Singapore, Singapore. melvin_leow@sics.a-star.edu.sg.']","Lijuan Sun, Hui Jen Goh, Priya Govindharajulu, Lei Sun, Christiani Jeyakumar Henry, Melvin Khee-Shing Leow, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32541662

433,Viruses join the circular RNA world,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently discovered class of noncoding RNAs found in many species across the eukaryotic kingdom. These intriguing RNA species are formed through a unique mechanism that is known as back splicing in which the 5' and 3' termini are covalently joined. Recent research has revealed that viruses also encode a repertoire of circRNAs. Some of these viral circRNAs are abundantly expressed and are reported to play a role in disease pathogenesis. A growing number of studies also indicate that host circRNAs are involved in immune responses against virus infections with either an antiviral or proviral role. In this review, we briefly introduce circRNA, its biogenesis, and mechanism of action. We go on to summarize the latest research on the expression, regulation, and functions of viral and host-encoded circRNAs during the host-virus interaction, with the aim of highlighting the potential of viral and host circRNAs as a suitable target for diagnostic biomarker development and therapeutic treatment of viral-associated diseases. We conclude by discussing the current limitations in knowledge and significance of elucidating the roles of circRNAs in host-virus interactions, as well as future directions for this emerging field.","['1 Faculty of Science, Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']","Ke-En Tan, Yat-Yuen Lim, ",The FEBS journal,NO_DATE,circRNA; circular RNA; miRNA sponge; noncoding RNA; virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33236482
434,"A comparison of COVID-19, SARS and MERS","In mid-December 2019, a novel atypical pneumonia broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019 Novel Coronavirus and subsequently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 19 May 2020, a total of 4,731,458 individuals were reported as infected with SARS-CoV-2 among 213 countries, areas or territories with recorded cases, and the overall case-fatality rate was 6.6% (316,169 deaths among 4,731,458 recorded cases), according to the World Health Organization. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is notably similar to (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that spread during 2012, and these viruses all contributed to global pandemics. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly spread a pneumonia-like disease from Hubei Province, China, throughout the world has provoked widespread concern. The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory signs. At present, nucleic acid tests are widely recommended as the optimal method for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, obstacles remain, including the global shortage of testing kits and the presentation of false negatives. Experts suggest that almost everyone in China is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to date, there are no effective treatments. In light of the references published, this review demonstrates the biological features, spread, diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and aims to analyse the similarities and differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to provide new ideas and suggestions for prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment.","['1 Department of Pediatrics, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '2 Transplantation Center, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', '3 Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha, China.']","Tingting Hu, Ying Liu, Mingyi Zhao, Quan Zhuang, Linyong Xu, Qingnan He, ",PeerJ,2020,COVID-19; Clinical presentations; Epidemiology; Laboratory diagnosis; MERS-CoV; Radiological features; SARS-CoV.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32879801

The maintenance of satellites requires their ability to associate with their helper viruses. Satellites can be categorized as either satellite viruses or satellite nucleic acids based on their ability to encode capsid proteins. Understanding the biology of satellites is important since they are pathogenic to a wide range of plant, animal, and yeast organisms. Most satellites influence the pathogenesis of their helper viruses by altering the interaction between the host and helper virus. However, the molecular mechanism that governs the trilateral interaction between host, satellites, and helper virus remains largely unexplored.

437,Subunit Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses,"Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

Additionally, cross-species transmissions of simian foamy viruses (SFVs) to humans have occurred following exposure to tissues of infected NHPs. Recent research has led to the identification of previously unknown exogenous foamy viruses, and to the discovery of endogenous spumaretrovirus sequences in a variety of host genomes. Here, we describe an updated spumaretrovirus taxonomy that has been recently accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Executive Committee, and describe a virus nomenclature that is generally consistent with that used for other retroviruses, such as lentiviruses and deltaretroviruses. This taxonomy can be applied to distinguish different, but closely related, primate (e.g., human, ape, simian) foamy viruses as well as those from other hosts.

440,Repurposing Therapeutics for Potential Treatment of SARS-CoV-2: A Review,"The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and suggests opportunities for further research.","['1 University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville, Greenville, SC 29605, USA.', '2 Department of Pharmacy, Prisma Health Upstate, Greenville, SC 29605, USA; Michael.Cohen@prismahealth.org .', '3 Department of Emergency Medicine Prisma Health Upstate, Greenville, SC 29605, USA.']","Jennifer Santos, Stephanie Brierley, Mohit J Gandhi, Michael A Cohen, Phillip C Moschella, Arwen B L Declan, ",Viruses,2020,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; repositioning; repurposing; therapeutics; treatment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32629804
441,A new era of virus bioinformatics,"Despite the recognized excellence of virology and bioinformatics, these two communities have interacted surprisingly sporadically, aside from some pioneering work on HIV-1 and influenza. Bringing together the expertise of bioinformaticians and virologists is crucial, since very specific but fundamental computational approaches are required for virus research, particularly in an era of big data. Collaboration between virologists and bioinformaticians is necessary to improve existing analytical tools, cloud-based systems, computational resources, data sharing approaches, new diagnostic tools, and bioinformatic training. Here, we highlight current progress and discuss potential avenues for future developments in this promising era of virus bioinformatics. We end by presenting an overview of current technologies, and by outlining some of the major challenges and advantages that bioinformatics will bring to the field of virology.","['1 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; RNA Bioinformatics and High Throughput Analysis Jena, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany.', '2 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; Host Parasite Evolution and Ecology, Institute of Biology, Free University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Department for Materials and Environment, BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Berlin, Germany.', '3 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Greifswald, Germany.', '4 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; Institute of Virology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, Munich, Germany.', '5 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; Swiss-Prot Group, SIB,CMU, University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland.', '6 MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', '7 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; Federal Department of Home Affairs, Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern and Mittelhausen, Switzerland; Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', '8 European Virus Bioinformatics Center, Jena, Germany; RNA Bioinformatics and High Throughput Analysis Jena, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany.

442,Cold and Exercise: Therapeutic Tools to Activate Brown Adipose Tissue and Combat Obesity,"The rise in obesity over the last several decades has reached pandemic proportions. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ that is involved in energy expenditure and represents an attractive target to combat both obesity and type 2 diabetes. Cold exposure and exercise training are two stimuli that have been investigated with respect to BAT activation, metabolism, and the contribution of BAT to metabolic health. These two stimuli are of great interest because they have both disparate and converging effects on BAT activation and metabolism. Cold exposure is an effective mechanism to stimulate BAT activity and increase glucose and lipid uptake through mitochondrial uncoupling, resulting in metabolic benefits including elevated energy expenditure and increased insulin sensitivity. Exercise is a therapeutic tool that has marked benefits on systemic metabolism and affects several tissues, including BAT. Compared to cold exposure, studies focused on BAT metabolism and exercise display conflicting results; the majority of studies in rodents and humans demonstrate a reduction in BAT activity and reduced glucose and lipid uptake and storage. In addition to investigations of energy uptake and utilization, recent studies have focused on the effects of cold exposure and exercise on the structural lipids in BAT and secreted factors released from BAT, termed batokines. Cold exposure and exercise induce opposite responses in terms of structural lipids, but an important overlap exists between the effects of cold and exercise on batokines. In this review, we will discuss the similarities and differences of cold exposure and exercise in relation to their effects on BAT activity and metabolism and its relevance for the prevention of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes.","['1 Dorothy M.

443,Bats and belief: A sequential qualitative study in Thailand,"Bats are wildlife and distribute globally. In Thailand, there are hundreds of bat species in different locations within four regions. However, few motivations and influences for having contact with bats have been documented. This sequential qualitative study was conducted in ten provinces representing the four regions of Thailand from September 2016 to June 2017. The study was designed to obtain information on villagers' attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and cultural contexts in relation to bats. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 305 respondents. Of these respondents, 142 (46.6%) reported coming into contact with bats through various activities, such as hunting, eating, cooking, collecting bat guano, cleaning bat feces, and finding carcasses in houses and communities. Villagers called bats by different names in different regions. They reported having been in contact with bats in different ways based on occupations, bat species, bat habitats, attitudes, perceptions, beliefs toward bats, and cultural contexts. Villagers in the northern and northeastern regions reported having regularly eaten bats. In contrast, the respondents in the central region did not eat bats due to local norms, religious beliefs, and regulations. By ethnicity, the Blu and Thai Dum groups reported coming into contact with and eating bats more often than the Thais. Our results provide evidence-based information on the human-bat interface in different regions in Thailand. The results of this qualitative study could be useful for strategic planning of proper education and interventions for bat conservation, bat contact behavior, and risk of bat-borne diseases among villagers in the future.","['1 Center of Excellence for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases in Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '2 Faculty of Nursing, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla Province, Thailand.', '3 School of Health Science, Mae Fah Luang University, Chiang Rai, Thailand.', '4 The Office of Disease Prevention and Control 7 Khon Kaen, Khon Kaen, Thailand.', '5 Faculty of Public Health, Mahasarakham University, Mahasarakham Province, Thailand.', '6 SUPA71 Co., Ltd, Bangkok, Thailand.', '7 Faculty of Nursing, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand.']","Kanokwan Suwannarong, Karnsunaphat Balthip, Phitsanuruk Kanthawee, Kangsadal Suwannarong, Santisith Khiewkhern, Cecilia Lantican, Thanomsin Ponlap, Nisachon Bupha, Alongkorn Amonsin, ",Heliyon,2020,Attitude; Bat; Belief; Conservation; Contact; Health sciences; Infectious disease; Interface; Perception; Public health; Religion; Sociology; Thailand.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32613107
444,Structural and functional insights into non-structural proteins of coronaviruses,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are causing a number of human and animal diseases because of their zoonotic nature such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses can infect respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous systems of human, livestock, birds, bat, mouse, and many wild animals. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerging respiratory virus and is causing CoVID-19 with high morbidity and considerable mortality. All CoVs belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, characterised by club-like spikes on their surfaces and large RNA genome with a distinctive replication strategy. Coronavirus have the largest RNA genomes (~26-32 kilobases) and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. Non-structural proteins (nsp) 7-16 are cleaved from two large replicase polyproteins and guide the replication and processing of coronavirus RNA. Coronavirus replicase has more or less universal activities, such as RNA polymerase (nsp 12) and helicase (nsp 13), as well as a variety of unusual or even special mRNA capping (nsp 14, nsp 16) and fidelity regulation (nsp 14) domains. Besides that, several smaller subunits (nsp 7- nsp 10) serve as essential cofactors for these enzymes and contribute to the emerging ""nsp interactome."" In spite of the significant progress in studying coronaviruses structural and functional properties, there is an urgent need to understand the coronaviruses evolutionary success that will be helpful to develop enhanced control strategies. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure, function, and interactions of coronaviruses RNA synthesizing machinery and their replication strategies.","['1 Department of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, 12211, Giza, Egypt; Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YG, UK.

Infections with HBV are more damaging when there is a coinfection with HDV. The genomes and modes of replication of these two viruses are fundamentally different, except for the fact that, in nature, HDV replication is dependent upon the envelope proteins of HBV to achieve assembly and release of infectious virus particles, ones that use the same host cell receptor. This review focuses on what has been found of the various ways, natural and experimental, by which HDV particles can be assembled and released. This knowledge has implications for the prevention and treatment of HDV infections, and maybe for an understanding of the origin of HDV.","['1 Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']","John M Taylor, ",Viruses,2020,coinfection; envelope proteins; hepatitis B virus; hepatitis delta virus; monoinfection; pseudotypes; superinfection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32560053
446,Potential Effects of Coronaviruses on the Cardiovascular System: A Review,"Importance:
        
      
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached a pandemic level. Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system. Observations:
        
      
      Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and conditions should be judiciously controlled per evidence-based guidelines.","['1 McGovern Medical School, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston.', '2 Texas Heart Institute, Houston.', ""3 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", '4 University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']","Mohammad Madjid, Payam Safavi-Naeini, Scott D Solomon, Orly Vardeny, ",JAMA cardiology,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219363
447,Antiviral activity of berberine,"Plants are a rich source of new antiviral, pharmacologically active agents. The naturally occurring plant alkaloid berberine (BBR) is one of the phytochemicals with a broad range of biological activity, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. BBR targets different steps in the viral life cycle and is thus a good candidate for use in novel antiviral drugs and therapies. It has been shown that BBR reduces virus replication and targets specific interactions between the virus and its host. BBR intercalates into DNA and inhibits DNA synthesis and reverse transcriptase activity. It inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This isoquinoline alkaloid has the ability to regulate the MEK-ERK, AMPK/mTOR, and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, it has been reported that BBR supports the host immune response, thus leading to viral clearance. In this short review, we focus on the most recent studies on the antiviral properties of berberine and its derivatives, which might be promising agents to be considered in future studies in the fight against the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","['1 Department of Animal Physiology and Developmental Biology, Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań, Poland. alicja@amu.edu.pl.', '2 NanoBioMedical Centre, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań, Poland. alicja@amu.edu.pl.', '3 Molecular Virology Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań, Poland.']","Alicja Warowicka, Robert Nawrot, Anna Goździcka-Józefiak, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32594322

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary, ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory failure. The mechanisms that determine such variable outcomes remain unresolved. Here we investigated CD4+ T cells that are reactive against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed healthy donors. We detected spike-reactive CD4+ T cells not only in 83% of patients with COVID-19 but also in 35% of healthy donors. Spike-reactive CD4+ T cells in healthy donors were primarily active against C-terminal epitopes in the spike protein, which show a higher homology to spike glycoproteins of human endemic coronaviruses, compared with N-terminal epitopes. Spike-protein-reactive T cell lines generated from SARS-CoV-2-naive healthy donors responded similarly to the C-terminal region of the spike proteins of the human endemic coronaviruses 229E and OC43, as well as that of SARS-CoV-2. This results indicate that spike-protein cross-reactive T cells are present, which were probably generated during previous encounters with endemic coronaviruses. The effect of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells on clinical outcomes remains to be determined in larger cohorts. However, the presence of spike-protein cross-reactive T cells in a considerable fraction of the general population may affect the dynamics of the current pandemic, and has important implications for the design and analysis of upcoming trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines.","[""1 Si-M/'Der Simulierte Mensch', Technische Universität Berlin and Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."", '2 Regenerative Immunology and Aging, BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '3 Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '4 Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.', '5 Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '6 Department of Tropical Medicine, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', '7 I.

449,Mutation and Epistasis in Influenza Virus Evolution,"Influenza remains a persistent public health challenge, because the rapid evolution of influenza viruses has led to marginal vaccine efficacy, antiviral resistance, and the annual emergence of novel strains. This evolvability is driven, in part, by the virus's capacity to generate diversity through mutation and reassortment. Because many new traits require multiple mutations and mutations are frequently combined by reassortment, epistatic interactions between mutations play an important role in influenza virus evolution. While mutation and epistasis are fundamental to the adaptability of influenza viruses, they also constrain the evolutionary process in important ways.

Given the health emergency, repurposing of existing antiviral, antiinflammatory or antimalarial drugs is an attractive option for controlling SARS-CoV-2 with drugs. However, phytochemicals selected based on ethnomedicinal information as well as in vitro antiviral studies could be promising as well. Here, we summarise the phytochemicals with reported anti-CoV activity, and further analyzed them computationally to accelerate validation for drug development against SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review started from the most potent phytocompounds (IC50 in μM) against SARS-CoV, followed by a cluster analysis to locate the most suitable lead(s). The advanced molecular docking used the crystallography structure of SARS-CoV-2-cysteine-like protease (SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro) as a target. In total, seventy-eight phytochemicals with anti-CoV activity against different strains in cellular assays, were selected for this computational study, and compared with two existing repurposed FDA-approved drugs: lopinavir and ritonavir. This review brings insights in the potential application of phytochemicals and their derivatives, which could guide researchers to develop safe drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Division of Microbiology and NCDs, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Odisha, India.', '2 Department of Biology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Center of Environment, Climate Change and Public Health, Utkal University, Vani Vihar, Odisha, India.', '3 Department of Biology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

453,Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan,"A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', ""2 Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", '3 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.', '4 Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.']","Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan, Kin-Hang Kok, Zheng Zhu, Hin Chu, Kelvin Kai-Wang To, Shuofeng Yuan, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Emerging microbes & infections,2020,Coronavirus; SARS; Wuhan; bioinformatics; emerging; genome; respiratory; virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31987001
454,Cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells is a high priority for deciphering its mystery and curbing its spread. A virus surface spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. To fulfill its function, SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. Here we investigated receptor binding and protease activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays. Our findings have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry. Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD. Third, unlike SARS-CoV, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is preactivated by proprotein convertase furin, reducing its dependence on target cell proteases for entry. The high hACE2 binding affinity of the RBD, furin preactivation of the spike, and hidden RBD in the spike potentially allow SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance.

455,The Microbiology of Coronaviruses,"The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening outcomes.","['1 Department of Microbiology, Al Nafees Medical College, Islamabad.']","Humaira Zafar, ",JPMA.

456,Virus classification - where do you draw the line?,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) and its use in recovering and assembling novel virus sequences from environmental, human clinical, veterinary and plant samples has unearthed a vast new catalogue of viruses. Their classification, known by their sequences alone, sets a major challenge to traditional virus taxonomy, especially at the family and species levels, which have been historically based largely on descriptive taxon definitions. These typically entail some knowledge of their phenotypic properties, including replication strategies, virion structure and clinical and epidemiological features, such as host range, geographical distribution and disease outcomes. Little to no information on these attributes is available, however, for viruses identified in metagenomic datasets. If such viruses are to be included in virus taxonomy, their assignments will have to be guided largely or entirely by metrics of genetic relatedness. The immediate problem here is that the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), an organisation that authorises the taxonomic classification of viruses, provides little or no guidance on how similar or how divergent viruses must be in order to be considered members of new species or new families. We have recently developed a method for scoring genomic (dis)similarity between viruses (Genome Relationships Applied to Virus Taxonomy - GRAViTy) among the eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses currently classified by the ICTV. At the family and genus levels, we found large-scale consistency between genetic relationships and their taxonomic assignments for eukaryotic viruses of all genome configurations and genome sizes. Family assignments of prokaryotic viruses have, however, been made at a quite different genetic level, and groupings currently classified as sub-families are a much better match to the eukaryotic virus family level. These findings support the ongoing reorganisation of bacteriophage taxonomy by the ICTV Phage Study Group. A rapid and objective means to explore metagenomic viral diversity and make evidence-based assignments for such viruses at each taxonomic layer is essential. Analysis of sequences by GRAViTy provides evidence that family (and genus) assignments of currently classified viruses are largely underpinned by genomic relatedness, and these features could serve as a guide towards an evidence-based classification of metagenomic viruses in the future.","['1 Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Peter Medawar Building, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3SY, UK.

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many countries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavirus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at understanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV.","['1 Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.', '2 Paediatric Medicine, Qatif Central Hospital, Qatif, Saudi Arabia.', '3 Research and Scientific Studies Unit, College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.', '4 Department of Microbiology, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Institute of Medicine, Kathmandu, Nepal.', '5 Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Sciences, UP Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhayay Pashu Chikitsa Vigyan Vishwavidyalay Evum Go-Anusandhan Sansthan (DUVASU), Mathura, India.', '6 Division of Biological Standardization, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India.', '7 Division of Pathology, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India.', '8 Sher-E-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir, Shalimar,Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '9 Semillero de Zoonosis, Grupo de Investigacion BIOECOS, Fundacion Universitaria Autonoma de las Americas, Sede Pereira, Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia; Public Health and Infection Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira, Pereira.', '10 Public Health and Infection Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira, Pereira, Colombia; Grupo de Investigacion Biomedicina, Faculty of Medicine, Fundacion Universitaria Autonoma de las Americas, Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia.']","Ali A Rabaan, Shamsah H Al-Ahmed, Shafiul Haque, Ranjit Sah, Ruchi Tiwari, Yashpal Singh Malik, Kuldeep Dhama, M Iqbal Yatoo, D Katterine Bonilla-Aldana, Alfonso J Rodriguez-Morales, ",Le infezioni in medicina,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32275259

Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients.

These are highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses which very likely originated in bats. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV, and spreads primarily through the respiratory tract. Although several trials for vaccine development are currently underway, investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the fundamental biology of the infectious cycle and the associated immunopathology underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are crucial for identification and rational design of effective therapies. This review provides an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 infects and spreads within human hosts with specific emphasis on key aspects of its lifecycle, tropism and immunopathological features.","['1 Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3RE, U.K.']","Sumana Sanyal, ",Emerging topics in life sciences,2020,SARS-CoV-2; coronaviruses; immune subversion; intracellular lifecycle; pathogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33269805

The outbreak of this virus has raised a number of questions: What is SARS-CoV-2? How transmissible is SARS-CoV-2? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for viral infection? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, we performed a comparative study of four pathogenic viruses that primarily attack the respiratory system and may cause death, namely, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 strains). This comparative study provides a critical evaluation of the origin, genomic features, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, this evaluation may inform public health administrators and medical experts to aid in curbing the pandemic's progression.","['1 Biomedical Informatics Research Lab, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', '2 Cancer Genomics Research Center, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.']","Zeinab Abdelrahman, Mengyuan Li, Xiaosheng Wang, ",Frontiers in immunology,2020,COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; influenza A virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33013925
462,SARS-CoV-2: Camazotz's Curse,"The world is currently face to face with a pandemic which is spreading rapidly across the globe caused by SARS-CoV-2, a strain of Coronaviruses (CoVs) belonging to subgenus Sarbecovirus of genus Betacoronavirus. World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 Feb 20 named this disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Covid-19. This pandemic is spreading rapidly and more than 20,00,000 cases have occurred globally. The human Coronaviruses discovered in 1960s were considered potentially harmless endemic viruses with seasonal distribution before late 2002. The CoVs are found in a large number of domestic and wild animals and birds. The first pandemic caused by Coronavirus caused by SARS-CoV was recognized in the late 2002 in Guangdong Province and resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality. This was followed by MERS-CoV which began in 2012 in the Arabian peninsula with multiple outbreaks related to it in various parts of the globe. Various studies have suggested how these viruses made their entry from their natural reservoir bats via intermediate host like civets and camels in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively. The intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 still needs to be established. The SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% similarity to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related-Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV RaTG13). SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be more distant in relation to SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%). At the whole genome sequence level pangolin CoV and SARSr-CoV RaTG13 show 91.02% and 96.2% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 but the S1 subunit of spike protein of pangolin CoV is more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than SARSr-CoV RaTG13. The genetic analysis of the currently circulating strains of the pandemic have shown 99.98-100% similarity in their genomes implying a recent shift to humans. The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be identified to implement control measures in the present pandemic. Also, how the virus moves interspecies will help predict and prevent future pandemics.","['1 Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune 411040, India.', '2 Assistant Professor, Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune 411040, India.', '3 Professor & Head, Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune 411040, India.', '4 Professor (Microbiology) & Dean and Deputy Commandant, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune 411040, India.']","K B Anand, S Karade, S Sen, R M Gupta, ","Medical journal, Armed Forces India",NO_DATE,COVID-19; Human coronavirus; MERS-CoV; SARS CoV-2; SARS-CoV.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32341622

We show here that G protein-coupled receptor protein 120 (GPR120) expression is dramatically induced after birth in mouse BAT. GPR120 expression in neonatal BAT is the highest among GPR120-expressing tissues in the mouse at any developmental stage tested. The induction of GPR120 in neonatal BAT is caused by postnatal thermal stress rather than by the initiation of suckling. GPR120-null neonates were found to be relatively intolerant to cold: close to one-third did not survive at 21°C, but all such pups survived at 25°C. Heat production in BAT was significantly impaired in GPR120-null pups. Deficiency in GPR120 did not modify brown adipocyte morphology or the anatomical architecture of BAT, as assessed by electron microscopy, but instead impaired the expression of uncoupling protein-1 and the fatty acid oxidation capacity of neonatal BAT. Moreover, GPR120 deficiency impaired fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) gene expression in BAT and reduced plasma FGF21 levels. These results indicate that GPR120 is essential for neonatal adaptive thermogenesis.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine and Institut de Biomedicina, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', '2 CIBER Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición, Madrid, Spain.']","Tania Quesada-López, Aleix Gavaldà-Navarro, Samantha Morón-Ros, Laura Campderrós, Roser Iglesias, Marta Giralt, Francesc Villarroya, ",American journal of physiology.

465,An updated and comprehensive review of the antiviral potential of essential oils and their chemical constituents with special focus on their mechanism of action against various influenza and coronaviruses,"Essential oils and their chemical constituents have been reported with well documented antimicrobial effects against a range of bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. By definition, essential oils are a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds which are synthesized naturally in different parts of the plant as part of plants secondary metabolism. The chemical composition of the essential oils is dominated by the presence of a range of compounds including phenolics, terpenoids, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, epoxides and many others inferring that essential oils must be effective against a wide range of pathogens. This review article mainly focuses on the antiviral potential of essential oils and their chemical constituents especially against influenza and coronaviruses. Essential oils have been screened against several pathogenic viruses, including influenza and other respiratory viral infections. The essential oils of cinnamon, bergamot, lemongrass, thyme, lavender have been reported to exert potent antiviral effects against influenza type A virus. The essential oil of Citrus reshni leaves has been shown to be effective against H5N1 virus. The essential oil of Lippia species at a concentration of 11.1 μg/mL has been shown to induce 100% inhibition of yellow fever virus in Vero cells. Essential oils and oleoresins have been shown through in vitro and in vivo experiments to induce antiviral effects against Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. A study reported 221 phytochemical compounds and essential oils to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using a cell-based assay measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6 cells. The main mechanism of antiviral effects of essential oils has been found to cause capsid disintegration and viral expansion which prevents the virus to infect host cells by adsorption via the capsid. Essential oils also inhibit hemagglutinin (an important membrane protein of various viruses) of certain viruses; this membrane protein allows the virus to enter the host cell. Many essential oils and their components could inhibit the late stages of viral life cycle by targeting the redox signalling pathway. Essential oils of Thymus vulgaris, cymbopogon citratus and Rosmarinus officinalis have been found to destabilize the Tat/TAR-RNA complex of HIV-1 virus, this complex being essential for HIV-1 replication. Being lipophilic in nature, essential oils can penetrate viral membranes easily leading to membrane disintegration. The current comprehensive review will facilitate researchers to find chemical entities from plant sources as possible inhibitory agents against various viruses.","['1 Department of Botany, Madhyanchal Professional University, Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal, 462044, India.', '2 Department of Botany, Madhyanchal Professional University, Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal, 462044, India.

466,Comparison of seven commercial RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19,"The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was ≥96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.","['1 National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Center for Infectious Disease Control, A. van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, 3721 MA, Bilthoven, the Netherlands.', ""2 Erasmus Medical Center, Viroscience Department, 's Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", '3 National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Center for Infectious Disease Control, A. van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9, 3721 MA, Bilthoven, the Netherlands.

The patients were divided into two groups as follows: BAT and control groups. The BAT group consists of 34 cases that showed BAT uptake. The control group, with no BAT uptake, included 68 patients who were matched for body mass index, gender, and season. The scans were retrospectively reviewed by two nuclear medicine physicians who visually evaluated the intensity of myocardial [18F] FDG uptake. The myocardial [18F] FDG uptake was visually classified into the following three patterns: diffuse, heterogeneous, and focal. The regions of activated BAT distribution were noted. The mean myocardial [18F] FDG uptake was 2.50 ± 0.75 for the BAT group and 2.13 ± 0.88 for the control group with a statistically significant difference (P = 0.031). The myocardial [18F] FDG uptake pattern was similar in the BAT and control groups with the diffuse pattern being the most common, followed by the heterogeneous and less commonly focal. In the BAT group, the anatomical distribution of BAT was mainly in supraclavicular, paravertebral, and axillary and to a lesser extent in cervical regions. BAT group had a significantly higher intensity of [18F] FDG myocardial uptake compared to that of the control group. The presence of activated BAT did not affect the pattern of myocardial uptake. Knowledge of these findings may help in understanding the variability of myocardial [18F] FDG uptake and consequently in avoiding misinterpretation of cardiac findings in positron-emission tomography/computed tomography studies.","['1 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Safat, Kuwait.', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Farwaniya Hospital, Sabah Al Nasser, Kuwait.', '3 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital, Jabriya, Kuwait.', '4 Jaber Al-Ahmad Center for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Kuwait City, Kuwait.', '5 Department of Radiology, Division of Nuclear Medicine, St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO, USA.']","Saud A Alenezi, Shorouk F Dannoon, Naheel S Alnafisi, Saqr M Asa'ad, Medhat M Osman, Abdelhamid H Elgazzar, ",World journal of nuclear medicine,2020,Activated brown adipose fat; fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose; myocardial uptake.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32190021

The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, Kumaun University, SSJ Campus, Almora, Uttarakhand, India; Department of Biotechnology, Kumaun University, Bhimtal Campus, Nainital, Uttarakhand, India.', '2 Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, Kumaun University, SSJ Campus, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.', '3 Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, Kumaun University, SSJ Campus, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.

472,ICTV Virus Taxonomy Profile: Ovaliviridae,"Ovaliviridae is a family of enveloped viruses with a linear dsDNA genome. The virions are ellipsoidal, and contain a multi-layered spool-like capsid. The viral genome is presumably replicated through protein priming by a putative DNA polymerase encoded by the virus. Progeny virions are released through hexagonal openings resulting from the rupture of virus-associated pyramids formed on the surface of infected cells. The only known host is a hyperthermophilic archaeon of the genus Sulfolobus. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Report on the family Ovaliviridae, which is available at ictv.global/report/ovaliviridae.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', '2 College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China.', '3 School of Water Resources and Environment, China University of Geosciences, Beijing 100083, PR China.']","Li Huang, Haina Wang, Ictv Report Consortium, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,ICTV Report; Ovaliviridae; taxonomy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33331812

In just 6 months, the virus had infected more than 7.5 million population worldwide, and in 10 months infected over 40 million. Clinical manifestation of Sars-CoV-2 range from mild symptoms like sneezing, coughing, cold and fever to severe respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute distress respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. The virus is highly contagious and transmits through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no treatment option available to treat Sars-CoV-2. Several research groups are working to explore different aspects of virus but further research is needed to fill the knowledge gaps. Herein, this review article provides latest update on genomic characterization, transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical manifestation of Sars-CoV-2.","['1 Department of Life Sciences, School of Sciences, University of Management and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan.', '2 Accident and Emergency Department, Shaikh Zayed Medical Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan.']","Dur E Nishwa, Hafiza Arooba Riaz, Ameer Fatima, Braira Wahid, ",Theoretical biology forum,2020,"Covid 19, Genome; Pathogenesis; Sars-CoV-2.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33929003
474,Coronavirus infections and immune responses,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive-sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts. In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.","['1 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Virology, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', '2 Laboratory Animal Center, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', '3 The First Clinical Medical College, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', '4 State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '5 The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', '6 School of Pubic Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']","Geng Li, Yaohua Fan, Yanni Lai, Tiantian Han, Zonghui Li, Peiwen Zhou, Pan Pan, Wenbiao Wang, Dingwen Hu, Xiaohong Liu, Qiwei Zhang, Jianguo Wu, ",Journal of medical virology,NO_DATE,chemokine; coronavirus; cytokines; inflammation; interferon.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31981224
475,The bZIP Proteins of Oncogenic Viruses,"Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) govern diverse cellular processes and cell fate decisions. The hallmark of the leucine zipper domain is the heptad repeat, with leucine residues at every seventh position in the domain. These leucine residues enable homo- and heterodimerization between ZIP domain α-helices, generating coiled-coil structures that stabilize interactions between adjacent DNA-binding domains and target DNA substrates. Several cancer-causing viruses encode viral bZIP TFs, including human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the herpesviruses Marek's disease virus (MDV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

476,"Coronavirus Infections in Companion Animals: Virology, Epidemiology, Clinical and Pathologic Features","Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses capable of causing respiratory, enteric, or systemic diseases in a variety of mammalian hosts that vary in clinical severity from subclinical to fatal. The host range and tissue tropism are largely determined by the coronaviral spike protein, which initiates cellular infection by promoting fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Companion animal coronaviruses responsible for causing enteric infection include feline enteric coronavirus, ferret enteric coronavirus, canine enteric coronavirus, equine coronavirus, and alpaca enteric coronavirus, while canine respiratory coronavirus and alpaca respiratory coronavirus result in respiratory infection. Ferret systemic coronavirus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, a mutated feline enteric coronavirus, can lead to lethal immuno-inflammatory systemic disease. Recent human viral pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, COVID-19, all thought to originate from bat coronaviruses, demonstrate the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and their potential to have devastating impacts. A better understanding of the coronaviruses of companion animals, their capacity for cross-species transmission, and the sharing of genetic information may facilitate improved prevention and control strategies for future emerging zoonotic coronaviruses. This article reviews the clinical, epidemiologic, virologic, and pathologic characteristics of nine important coronaviruses of companion animals.","['1 School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '2 Graduate Group Integrative Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '3 Department of Medicine & Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '4 Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.']","Christine Haake, Sarah Cook, Nicola Pusterla, Brian Murphy, ",Viruses,2020,COVID-19; SARS Virus; canine; coronavirus; feline infectious peritonitis; ferrets; spike glycoproteins; zoonoses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32933150
477,Comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid antigen test to the real star Sars-CoV-2 RT PCR kit,"There is an ongoing need for reliable antigen assays for timely and easy detection of individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using 75 swabs from patients previously tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and 75 swabs from patients previously tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche). We determined a specificity of 96 %. The assay's sensitivity with samples with a cycle threshold of < 25, 25 - <30, 30 - <35, and> = 35 was 100 %, 95 %, 44.8 % and 22.2 %, respectively. We conclude that sensitivity and specificity of the antigen assay is inferior to the PCR assay. However, the antigen assay may be a quick and easy to perform alternative for differentiation of individuals contagious for SARS-CoV-2 from non-contagious individuals.","['1 LaboratoryDiagnostic CEnter, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany.', '2 Department of Pneumology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany.', '3 Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany.', '4 LaboratoryDiagnostic CEnter, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany.

Increasing evidence suggests that some MRVs can cause severe respiratory disease and encephalitis in humans and other animals. Previously, we isolated six bat MRV strains. However, the pathogenicity of these bat viruses remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the host range and pathogenicity of 3 bat MRV strains (WIV2, 3 and 7) which represent three serotypes. Our results showed that all of them can infect cell lines from different mammalian species and displayed different replication efficiency. The BALB/c mice infected by bat MRVs showed clinical symptoms with systematic infection especially in lung and intestines. Obvious tissue damage were found in all infected lungs. One of the strains, WIV7, showed higher replication efficiency in vitro and vivo and more severe pathogenesis in mice. Our results provide new evidence showing potential pathogenicity of bat MRVs in animals and probable risk in humans.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '2 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '3 Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '4 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.

479,Host Factors in Coronavirus Replication,"Coronaviruses are pathogens with a serious impact on human and animal health. They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections, and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome and employ a complex genome expression strategy. Next to a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the coronavirus-host interplay. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication, by altering host gene expression or by counteracting the host's antiviral defenses. These coronavirus-host interactions are key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine the outcome of infection. Due to the complexity of the coronavirus proteome and replication cycle, our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other +RNA viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of coronavirus-host interactions at the level of the infected cell, with special attention for the assembly and function of the viral RNA-synthesising machinery and the evasion of cellular innate immune responses.","['1 Molecular Virology Laboratory, Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', '2 Molecular Virology Laboratory, Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. m.j.van_hemert@lumc.nl.']","Adriaan H de Wilde, Eric J Snijder, Marjolein Kikkert, Martijn J van Hemert, ",Current topics in microbiology and immunology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28643204

Very recently, coronaviruses (CoV), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit neurotropic properties and may also cause neurological diseases. It is reported that CoV can be found in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. The pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses is still incompletely known, and it is therefore important to explore the impact of CoV infections on the nervous system. Here, we review the research into neurological complications in CoV infections and the possible mechanisms of damage to the nervous system.","['1 Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Department of Cardiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou 213003, China.', '2 Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', '3 Department of Cardiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou 213003, China.', '4 Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', '5 Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.

481,Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion,"Recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, along with the threat of a future coronavirus-mediated pandemic, underscore the importance of finding ways to combat these viruses. The trimeric spike transmembrane glycoprotein S mediates entry into host cells and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the humoral immune response elicited upon natural infections with coronaviruses, we structurally characterized the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins in complex with neutralizing antibodies isolated from human survivors. Although the two antibodies studied blocked attachment to the host cell receptor, only the anti-SARS-CoV S antibody triggered fusogenic conformational changes via receptor functional mimicry. These results provide a structural framework for understanding coronavirus neutralization by human antibodies and shed light on activation of coronavirus membrane fusion, which takes place through a receptor-driven ratcheting mechanism.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA; Institute Pasteur & CNRS UMR 3569, Unité de Virologie Structurale, 75015, Paris, France.', '3 Humabs Biomed SA, Vir Biotechnology, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.', '4 National Infection Service, Public Health England, London NW9 5HT, UK.', '5 Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK.', '6 Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Università della Svizzera italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.', '7 Institute Pasteur & CNRS UMR 3569, Unité de Virologie Structurale, 75015, Paris, France.', '8 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.

Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Institute Pasteur & CNRS UMR 3569, Unité de Virologie Structurale, Paris 75015, France.', '3 Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', '4 Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', '5 Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.

483,Human coronavirus spike protein-host receptor recognition,"A variety of coronaviruses (CoVs) have infected humans and caused mild to severe respiratory diseases that could result in mortality. The human CoVs (HCoVs) belong to the genera of α- and β-CoVs that originate in rodents and bats and are transmitted to humans via zoonotic contacts. The binding of viral spike proteins to the host cell receptors is essential for mediating fusion of viral and host cell membranes to cause infection. The SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats (RaTG13 SARS-CoV) and is transmitted to humans via pangolins. The presence of 'PRRA' sequence motif in SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins from human, dog, cat, mink, tiger and lion suggests a common viral entry mechanism into host cells. In this review, we discuss structural features of HCoV spike proteins and recognition of host protein and carbohydrate receptors.","['1 School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, 500046, India.

      The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already occur. Aim:
        
      
      We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. Methods:
        
      
      Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results:
        
      
      The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV.
