0,ORF8-Related Genetic Evidence for Chinese Horseshoe Bats as the Source of Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"Several lineage B betacoronaviruses termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) were identified from Rhinolophus bats in China. These viruses are characterized by a set of unique accessory open reading frames (ORFs) that are located between the M and N genes. Among unique accessory ORFs, ORF8 is most hypervariable. In this study, the ORF8s of all SL-CoVs were classified into 3 types, and, for the first time, it was found that very few SL-CoVs from Rhinolophus sinicus have ORF8s that are identical to that of human SARS-CoV. This finding provides new genetic evidence for Chinese horseshoe bats as the source of human SARS-CoV.","['1 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, Institute of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai.', ""3 College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, People's Republic of China."", '4 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou.']","Zhiqiang Wu, Li Yang, Xianwen Ren, Junpeng Zhang, Fan Yang, Shuyi Zhang, Qi Jin, ",The Journal of infectious diseases,2016,ORF8; bats; origin; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26433221
1,Detection of diverse viruses in alimentary specimens of bats in Macau,"Bats carry a variety of viruses, and some of them cause public health problems. Macau, which is famous for its gambling industry, has a complex population structure. The globalization in such an international metropolis has enhanced the chance of disease transmission. Therefore, surveillance of zoonotic viruses is necessary for the early warning of potential emerging infectious diseases. Here, we report the first surveillance of bat viruses in Macau. In this study, we collected 1004 samples involving 10 bat species from 7 sites from April 2015 to May 2016, and examined the presence of viruses using nucleic acid-based methods. Coronaviruses, adenoviruses and paramyxoviruses were detected in these samples, with a high prevalence of coronaviruses. While, none was positive for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus or hantavirus. Co-infections are not common in those bat species, but coronavirus HKU6 and adenovirus can be found commonly occurred in Myotis ricketti.","['1 College of Life Science, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, 510006, China.', '2 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', '3 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China.', '4 Macau Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau, Macao SAR, China.', '5 College of Life Science, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, 510006, China. wuyizhouq@263.net.', '6 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangzhou, 510260, China. zhanglb@gdei.gd.cn.']","Jie Liang, Xing-Lou Yang, Bei Li, Qi Liu, Qin Zhang, Hui Liu, Hon-Pio Kan, Kai-Chin Wong, Si-Nga Chek, Xiangyang He, Xingwen Peng, Zheng-Li Shi, Yi Wu, Libiao Zhang, ",Virologica Sinica,NO_DATE,adenovirus; bat virus; coronavirus; paramyxovirus; viral detection.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28589292
2,"Genomic Characterization of a Novel Alphacoronavirus Isolated from Bats, Korea, 2020","Coronavirus, an important zoonotic disease, raises concerns of future pandemics. The bat is considered a source of noticeable viruses resulting in human and livestock infections, especially the coronavirus. Therefore, surveillance and genetic analysis of coronaviruses in bats are essential in order to prevent the risk of future diseases. In this study, the genome of HCQD-2020, a novel alphacoronavirus detected in a bat (Eptesicus serotinus), was assembled and described using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The comparison of the whole-genome sequence and the conserved amino acid sequence of replicated proteins revealed that the new strain was distantly related with other known species in the Alphacoronavirus genus. Phylogenetic construction indicated that this strain formed a separated branch with other species, suggesting a new species of Alphacoronavirus. Additionally, in silico prediction also revealed the risk of cross-species infection of this strain, especially in the order Artiodactyla. In summary, this study provided the genetic characteristics of a possible new species belonging to Alphacoronavirus.","['1 Virology Lab, Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine and Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.', '2 Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.', '3 Department of Life Science, Dongguk University, Gyeongju 38066, Korea.', '4 Noah Biotech Research Unit, Noah Biotech Co., Ltd., Suwon 16612, Korea.', '5 Institute of Genome Research, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.', '6 Department of Medical Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', '7 Department of Veterinary Medicine Microbology Lab, College of Veterinary Medicine and Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea.']","Hai-Quynh Do, Van-Giap Nguyen, Chul-Un Chung, Yong-Shin Jeon, Sook Shin, Kuem-Chan Jang, Le Bich Hang Pham, Aeri Kong, Cheong-Ung Kim, Yong-Ho Park, Bong-Kyun Park, Hee-Chun Chung, ",Viruses,2021,Alphacoronavirus; Korea; bat; novel species.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34696471
3,Complete genome sequence of a novel bat mastadenovirus C strain isolated from Rhinolophus cornutus in Japan,"Here, we report a novel bat adenovirus strain isolated from apparently healthy bats of the species Rhinolophus cornutus in Japan. The genome of the isolate was 36,506 bp in length and encoded at least 33 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA polymerase amino acid sequence, which provides one demarcation criterion for adenoviral species, indicated that the isolate belongs to the species Bat mastadenovirus C in the genus Mastadenovirus. Most of the encoded proteins shared high sequence similarity with those of known bat adenovirus C strains detected in different species of Rhinolophus, whereas the fiber protein and some E3- and E4-related proteins shared moderate similarity, and only the large E3 protein, which contains several host immune-suppression-related motifs, showed considerably lower similarity.","['1 Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.', '2 Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan. shin-murakami@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', '3 Laboratory of Veterinary Public Health, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '4 Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan. taihorimoto@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']","Misa Katayama, Shin Murakami, Hiromichi Matsugo, Haruhiko Kamiki, Marina Fujii, Akiko Takenaka-Uema, Taisuke Horimoto, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35112204
4,Molecular detection of bat coronaviruses in three bat species in Indonesia,"Bats are an important reservoir of several zoonotic diseases. However, the circulation of bat coronaviruses (BatCoV) in live animal markets in Indonesia has not been reported. Genetic characterization of BatCoV was performed by sequencing partial RdRp genes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction based on nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the N protein were conducted to detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA and antibody, respectively. We identified the presence of BatCoV on Cynopterus brachyotis, Macroglossus minimus, and Rousettus amplexicaudatus.

5,"Complete genomes of Aravan, Khujand, Irkut and West Caucasian bat viruses, with special attention to the polymerase gene and non-coding regions","The purpose of this study was to generate complete genome sequences of Aravan (ARAV), Khujand (KHUV), Irkut (IRKV) and West Caucasian bat (WCBV) viruses, and to compare them with genomes of other lyssaviruses. We focused on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L) and non-coding regions, because other genes of these viruses have been described previously. The L protein is organized into six conserved blocks (I-VI), previously detected in all Mononegavirales. Furthermore, lyssaviruses have two additional conserved regions, L1 and L2, located in the COOH part of the L. L1 may be responsible for methylation of viral mRNA cap structures, whereas the significance of L2 is unclear. Phylogenetic patterns based on the L are similar to those described for the nucleoprotein. The WCBV is the most divergent member of the genus. Besides phylogeny, it has a short trailer region (57 nucleotides versus 69-70 nucleotides in other lyssaviruses) and different intergenic region lengths, including an exceptionally long non-coding region of the glycoprotein (697 nucleotides) containing a potential open reading frame of 180 nucleotides. The absence of a flanking transcription initiation signal, as well as Northern and Western blot data, suggests that this region is not independently transcribed but is a part of G mRNA.","['1 Rabies Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, MS G-33 Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. ibk3@cdc.gov']","Ivan V Kuzmin, Xianfu Wu, Noel Tordo, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18514350

7,"New lyssavirus genotype from the Lesser Mouse-eared Bat (Myotis blythi), Kyrghyzstan","The Aravan virus was isolated from a Lesser Mouse-eared Bat (Myotis blythi) in the Osh region of Kyrghyzstan, central Asia, in 1991. We determined the complete sequence of the nucleoprotein (N) gene and compared it with those of 26 representative lyssaviruses obtained from databases. The Aravan virus was distinguished from seven distinct genotypes on the basis of nucleotide and amino acid identity. Phylogenetic analysis based on both nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed that the Aravan virus was more closely related to genotypes 4, 5, and--to a lesser extent--6, which circulates among insectivorus bats in Europe and Africa. The Aravan virus does not belong to any of the seven known genotypes of lyssaviruses, namely, rabies, Lagos bat, Mokola, and Duvenhage viruses and European bat lyssavirus 1, European bat lyssavirus 2, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Based on these data, we propose a new genotype for the Lyssavirus genus.","['1 Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. yarai@nih.go.jp']","Yohko T Arai, Ivan V Kuzmin, Yosuke Kameoka, Alexandr D Botvinkin, ",Emerging infectious diseases,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12643828
8,Genetic diversity of adenoviruses in bats of China,"Adenovirus remains a significant threat to public health. Recent studies showed that bats can harbor diverse adenoviruses. To further investigate the distribution and genetic diversity of bat adenoviruses in China, we collected throat and anal swab samples of 11 bat species from 6 provinces of China, including Beijing, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and Hainan. Nested PCR was used to identify potential bat adenoviruses from the samples, and positive results were cloned and sequenced for genetic diversity study. In addition, nucleotide sequence alignments based on corresponding amino acid sequence similarities were used for phylogenetic analyses. Our results showed that about 20% of bat species in China are positive to adenoviruses, and Myotis ricketti is likely to be the most important host of bat adenoviruses in all locations. Moreover, we identified two diverse sequences of bat adenoviruses from the same sample of Ia io in Guizhou province of China. In general, the average nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities of the conserved region of DNA polymerases of bat adenoviruses are 66.6% and 74.7%, respectively. The differences between bat species and their residences environments may have driven the adaptive evolution of the viruses, leading to the genetic diversity of the bat adenoviruses.","['1 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100176, China. chenlh@ipbcams.ac.cn']","Li-Hong Chen, Zhi-Qiang Wu, Yong-Feng Hu, Fan Yang, Jian Yang, Qi Jin, ",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22978165
9,Novel viruses detected in bats in the Republic of Korea,"Bats are natural reservoirs for potential zoonotic viruses. In this study, next-generation sequencing was performed to obtain entire genome sequences of picornavirus from a picornavirus-positive bat feces sample (16BF77) and to explore novel viruses in a pooled bat sample (16BP) from samples collected in South Korea, 2016. Fourteen mammalian viral sequences were identified from 16BF77 and 29 from 16BP, and verified by RT-PCR. The most abundant virus in 16BF77 was picornavirus. Highly variable picornavirus sequences encoding 3Dpol were classified into genera Kobuvirus, Shanbavirus, and an unassigned group within the family Picornaviridae. Amino acid differences between these partial 3Dpol sequences were ≥ 65.7%. Results showed that one bat was co-infected by picornaviruses of more than two genera. Retrovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus A sequences also were found in the BP sample. The retrovirus and coronavirus genomes were identified in nine and eight bats, respectively. Korean bat retroviruses and coronavirus demonstrated strong genetic relationships with a Chinese bat retrovirus (RfRV) and coronavirus (HKU5-1), respectively. A co-infection was identified in one bat with a retrovirus and a coronavirus. Our results indicate that Korean bats were multiply infected by several mammal viruses.","['1 Laboratory of Veterinary Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jeonbuk National University, Iksan, Chonbuk, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Life Science, Dongguk University, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea.', '3 Laboratory of Veterinary Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jeonbuk National University, Iksan, Chonbuk, Republic of Korea. jku0623@jbnu.ac.kr.', '4 Department of Veterinary Infectious Diseases, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jeonbuk National University, Iksan, Republic of Korea. jku0623@jbnu.ac.kr.']","Sook-Young Lee, Chul-Un Chung, Jun Soo Park, Jae-Ku Oem, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33219309
10,"Host range, prevalence, and genetic diversity of adenoviruses in bats","Bats are the second largest group of mammals on earth and act as reservoirs of many emerging viruses. In this study, a novel bat adenovirus (AdV) (BtAdV-TJM) was isolated from bat fecal samples by using a bat primary kidney cell line. Infection studies indicated that most animal and human cell lines are susceptible to BtAdV-TJM, suggesting a possible wide host range. Genome analysis revealed 30 putative genes encoding proteins homologous to their counterparts in most known AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis placed BtAdV-TJM within the genus Mastadenovirus, most closely related to tree shrew and canine AdVs. PCR analysis of 350 bat fecal samples, collected from 19 species in five Chinese provinces during 2007 and 2008, indicated that 28 (or 8%) samples were positive for AdVs. The samples were from five bat species, Hipposideros armiger, Myotis horsfieldii, M. ricketti, Myotis spp., and Scotophilus kuhlii. The prevalence ranged from 6.25% (H. armiger in 2007) to 40% (M. ricketti in 2007). Comparison studies based on available partial sequences of the pol gene demonstrated a great genetic diversity among bat AdVs infecting different bat species as well as those infecting the same bat species. This is the first report of a genetically diverse group of DNA viruses in bats. Our results support the notion, derived from previous studies based on RNA viruses (especially coronaviruses and astroviruses), that bats seem to have the unusual ability to harbor a large number of genetically diverse viruses within a geographic location and/or within a taxonomic group.","['1 State key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn']","Yan Li, Xingyi Ge, Huajun Zhang, Peng Zhou, Yan Zhu, Yunzhi Zhang, Junfa Yuan, Lin-Fa Wang, Zhengli Shi, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20089640
11,Diversity and Evolution of Viral Pathogen Community in Cave Nectar Bats ( Eonycteris spelaea),"Bats are unique mammals, exhibit distinctive life history traits and have unique immunological approaches to suppression of viral diseases upon infection. High-throughput next-generation sequencing has been used in characterizing the virome of different bat species. The cave nectar bat, Eonycteris spelaea, has a broad geographical range across Southeast Asia, India and southern China, however, little is known about their involvement in virus transmission. Here we investigate the diversity and abundance of viral communities from a colony of Eonycteris spelaea residing in Singapore. Our results detected 47 and 22 different virus families from bat fecal and urine samples, respectively. Among these, we identify a large number of virus families including Adenoviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Polyomaviridae. In most cases, viral sequences from Eonycteris spelaea are genetically related to a group of bat viruses from other bat genera (e.g., Eidolon, Miniopterus, Rhinolophus and Rousettus). The results of this study improve our knowledge of the host range, spread and evolution of several important viral pathogens. More significantly, our findings provide a baseline to study the temporal patterns of virus shedding and how they correlate with bat phenological trends.","['1 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. ian.mendenhall@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '2 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. dolyce.low@u.nus.edu.', '3 NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119077, Singapore. dolyce.low@u.nus.edu.', '4 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. jayanthi.jayakumar@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '5 Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore 138671, Singapore. vithiagarang@bii.a-star.edu.sg.', '6 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. linfa.wang@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '7 Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore 138671, Singapore. sebastianms@bii.a-star.edu.sg.', '8 Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117558, Singapore. sebastianms@bii.a-star.edu.sg.', '9 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. yvonne.su@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '10 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. gavin.smith@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '11 SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute, SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre, Singapore 168753, Singapore. gavin.smith@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '12 Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA. gavin.smith@duke-nus.edu.sg.']","Ian H Mendenhall, Dolyce Low Hong Wen, Jayanthi Jayakumar, Vithiagaran Gunalan, Linfa Wang, Sebastian Mauer-Stroh, Yvonne C F Su, Gavin J D Smith, ",Viruses,2019,Metaviromics; Southeast Asia; adenovirus; bunyavirus; flavivirus; herpesvirus; papillomavirus; paramyxovirus; parvovirus; picornavirus; polyomavirus; poxvirus; reovirus; rotavirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30871070

A total of 8,746,417 reads with a length of 306,124,595 bp were obtained. Among these reads, 13,541 (0.15%) had similarity to phage sequences and 9,170 (0.1%) had similarity to eukaryotic virus sequences. A total of 129 assembled contigs (>100 nucleotides) were constructed and compared with GenBank: 32 contigs were related to phages, and 97 were related to eukaryotic viruses. The most frequent reads and contigs related to eukaryotic viruses were homologous to densoviruses, dicistroviruses, coronaviruses, parvoviruses, and tobamoviruses, a range that includes viruses from invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants. Most of the contigs had low identities to known viral genomic or protein sequences, suggesting that a large number of novel and genetically diverse insect viruses as well as putative mammalian viruses are transmitted by bats in China.

The geographic distributions of the bats involved differed from previous reports. Three out of nine species of bats were observed to harbor astroviruses. These included Miniopterus schreibersii, Scotophilus kuhlii, and Rousettus leschenaultia. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences of partial ORFs of astroviruses revealed that the bat astroviruses are not only divergent from previously described human and other animal astroviruses but also show remarkable diversity among themselves. However, five bat astroviruses were phylogenetically related to mink astrovirus, ovine astrovirus, and the recently discovered human astroviruses VA1, VA2, and VA3.

In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat faecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a similar genomic organization to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the family Circoviridae. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1741 to 2177 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem-loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved nonanucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Among 199 samples tested, 47 were positive (23.6%) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study.

18,Prevalence and genetic diversity of adeno-associated viruses in bats from China,"Bats are increasingly being recognized as important natural reservoirs of different viruses. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are widely distributed in primates and their distribution in bats is unknown. In this study, a total of 370 faecal swab samples from 19 bat species were collected from various provinces of China and examined for the presence of AAVs. The mean prevalence rate was 22.4% (83 positives out of 370 samples), ranging from 10 to 38.9% among different bat species. The genome sequence spanning the entire rep-cap ORFs was determined from one chosen AAV-positive sample (designated BtAAV-YNM). Phylogenetic analysis of the entire rep-cap ORF coding sequences suggested that BtAAV-YNM is relatively distant to known primate AAVs, but phylogenetically closer to porcine AAV strain Po3. Further analysis of the partial cap ORF sequences of bat AAV samples (n=49) revealed a remarkably large genetic diversity, with an average pairwise nucleotide identity of only 84.3%. Co-presence of multiple distinctive genotypes of bat AAV within an individual sample was also observed. These results demonstrated that diverse AAVs might be widely distributed in bat populations.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Wuhan, PR China.']","Yan Li, Xingyi Ge, Chung-Chau Hon, Huajun Zhang, Peng Zhou, Yunzhi Zhang, Yi Wu, Lin-Fa Wang, Zhengli Shi, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20573859
19,"Epidemiology and Genomic Characterization of Two Novel SARS-Related Coronaviruses in Horseshoe Bats from Guangdong, China","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agents of SARS, which broke out in 2003, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), which broke out in 2019, probably originated in Rhinolophus sinicus and R. affinis, respectively. Rhinolophus bats are important hosts for coronaviruses. Many SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been detected in bats from different areas of China; however, the diversity of bat SARSr-CoVs is increasing, and their transmission mechanisms have attracted much attention. Here, we report the findings of SARSr-CoVs in R. sinicus and R. affinis from South China from 2008 to 2021. The full-length genome sequences of the two novel SARSr-CoVs obtained from Guangdong shared 83 to 88% and 71 to 72% nucleotide identities with human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, while sharing high similarity with human SARS-CoV in hypervariable open reading frame 8 (ORF8). Significant recombination occurred between the two novel SARSr-CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two novel bat SARSr-CoVs from Guangdong were more distant than the bat SARSr-CoVs from Yunnan to human SARS-CoV. We found that transmission in bats contributes more to virus diversity than time. Although our results of the sequence analysis of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and the expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inferred that these viruses could not directly infect humans, risks still exist after some unpredictable mutations. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity and transmission of SARSr-CoVs carried by bats in the field. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 probably originated from the SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) carried by Rhinolophus bats from Yunnan, China. Systematic investigations of the reservoir hosts carrying SARSr-CoVs in Guangdong and the reservoir distribution and transmission are urgently needed to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we detected SARSr-CoV in Rhinolophus bat samples from Guangdong in 2009 and 2021 and found that the transmission of SARSr-CoV from different host populations contributes more to increased virus diversity than time. Bat SARSr-CoVs in Guangdong had genetic diversity, and Guangdong was also the hot spot for SARSr-CoVs. We once again prove that R. sinicus plays an important role in the maintenance of the SARS-CoVs. Besides, the SARSr-CoVs are mainly transmitted through the intestines in bats, and these SARSr-CoVs found in Guangdong could not use human ACE2 (hACE2), but whether they can pass through intermediate hosts or directly infect humans requires further research. Our findings demonstrate the ability of SARSr-CoVs to spread across species.","['1 College of Life Science and Technology, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China.', '2 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', '3 College of Forestry, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China.']","Linmiao Li, Libiao Zhang, Jiabin Zhou, Xiangyang He, Yepin Yu, Ping Liu, Wenzhong Huang, Zuofu Xiang, Jinping Chen, ",mBio,2022,SARS-related coronavirus; epidemiology; genetic diversity; horseshoe bats.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35467426
20,"Full Genome of batCoV/MinFul/2018/SriLanka, a Novel Alpha-Coronavirus Detected in Miniopterus fuliginosus, Sri Lanka","Coronaviruses (CoV) are divided into the genera α-CoVs, β-CoVs, γ-CoVs and δ-CoVs. Of these, α-CoVs and β-CoVs are solely capable of causing infections in humans, resulting in mild to severe respiratory symptoms. Bats have been identified as natural reservoir hosts for CoVs belonging to these two genera. Consequently, research on bat populations, CoV prevalence in bats and genetic characterization of bat CoVs is of special interest to investigate the potential transmission risks. We present the genome sequence of a novel α-CoV strain detected in rectal swab samples of Miniopterus fuliginosus bats from a colony in the Wavul Galge cave (Koslanda, Sri Lanka). The novel strain is highly similar to Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1, an α-CoV located in the subgenus of Minunacoviruses. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed a high identity of the novel strain to other α-CoVs derived from Miniopterus bats, while human-pathogenic α-CoV strains like HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 were more distantly related. Comparison with selected bat-related and human-pathogenic strains of the β-CoV genus showed low identities of ~40%. Analyses of the different genes on nucleotide and amino acid level revealed that the non-structural ORF1a/1b are more conserved among α-CoVs and β-CoVs, while there are higher variations in the structural proteins known to be important for host specificity. The novel strain was named batCoV/MinFul/2018/SriLanka and had a prevalence of 50% (66/130) in rectal swab samples and 58% (61/104) in feces samples that were collected from Miniopterus bats in Wavul Galge cave. Based on the differences between strain batCoV/MinFul/2018/SriLanka and human-pathogenic α-CoVs and β-CoVs, we conclude that there is a rather low transmission risk to humans. Further studies in the Wavul Galge cave and at other locations in Sri Lanka will give more detailed information about the prevalence of this virus.","['1 Centre for Biological Threats and Special Pathogens, Highly Pathogenic Viruses (ZBS 1), Robert Koch Institute, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', '2 Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Colombo, Colombo 00300, Sri Lanka.', '3 IDEA (Identification of Emerging Agents) Laboratory, Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences, University of Colombo, Colombo 00300, Sri Lanka.', '4 Centre for International Health Protection, Public Health Laboratory Support (ZIG 4), Robert Koch Institute, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', '5 Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama 11010, Sri Lanka.']","Therese Muzeniek, Thejanee Perera, Sahan Siriwardana, Dilara Bas, Fatimanur Kaplan, Mizgin Öruc, Beate Becker-Ziaja, Inoka Perera, Jagathpriya Weerasena, Shiroma Handunnetti, Franziska Schwarz, Gayani Premawansa, Sunil Premawansa, Wipula Yapa, Andreas Nitsche, Claudia Kohl, ",Viruses,2022,Miniopterus fuliginosus; Sri Lanka; bat alphacoronavirus; cave-dwelling; coronavirus; full genome; one health; sympatric colony.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35215931

Preliminary studies with anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies suggested that the viruses were distinct from other lyssavirus serotypes. These data were supported by sequencing of the N gene of Aravan virus. In the present study, we sequenced the entire N, P and G genes of both Aravan and Khujand viruses and compared them with respective sequences of other lyssaviruses available from GenBank. The results suggested that each virus should be considered as a newly recognized genotype according to the current approaches for genotype definition (amount of nucleotide identity of the N gene and bootstrap support of joining to certain phylogenetic groups). Use of different phylogenetic methods and comparison of different parts of the genomes generally suggested that Khujand virus was mainly related to genotype 6, while Aravan virus, on the one hand, was related to Khujand virus, and, on the other hand, demonstrated moderate similarity to genotypes 4, 5 and 6. The potential significance of these new lyssaviruses for veterinary and public health should not be underestimated.","['1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Cliffton Road, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.']","Ivan V Kuzmin, Lillian A Orciari, Yohko T Arai, Jean S Smith, Cathleen A Hanlon, Yosuke Kameoka, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14602198

To extensively understand the distribution and genetic diversity of astrovirus in small mammals, we tested 968 anal swabs from 39 animal species, most of which were bats and rodents. We detected diverse astroviruses in 10 bat species, including known bat astroviruses and a large number of novel viruses. Meanwhile, novel groups of astroviruses were identified in three wild rodent species and a remarkably high genetic diversity of astrovirus was revealed in Eothenomys cachinus. We detected astroviruses in captive-bred porcupines and a nearly full-length genome sequence was determined for one strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete ORF2 sequence suggested that this strain may share a common ancestor with porcine astrovirus type 2.

26,Presence of Recombinant Bat Coronavirus GCCDC1 in Cambodian Bats,"Bats have been recognized as an exceptional viral reservoir, especially for coronaviruses. At least three bat zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to cause severe diseases in humans and it is expected more will emerge. One of the major features of CoVs is that they are all highly prone to recombination. An extreme example is the insertion of the P10 gene from reoviruses in the bat CoV GCCDC1, first discovered in Rousettus leschenaultii bats in China. Here, we report the detection of GCCDC1 in four different bat species (Eonycteris spelaea, Cynopterus sphinx, Rhinolophus shameli and Rousettus sp.) in Cambodia. This finding demonstrates a much broader geographic and bat species range for this virus and indicates common cross-species transmission. Interestingly, one of the bat samples showed a co-infection with an Alpha CoV most closely related to RsYN14, a virus recently discovered in the same genus (Rhinolophus) of bat in Yunnan, China, 2020.

27,Deciphering the bat virome catalog to better understand the ecological diversity of bat viruses and the bat origin of emerging infectious diseases,"Studies have demonstrated that ~60%-80% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans originated from wild life. Bats are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals. However, the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear, which complicates the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout China. The purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses.

Additionally, we discovered a bastro-like virus (Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus), with a genomic organization similar to Hepeviridae.

Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (≥200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (<70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses.

Thus, it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been reported in bat species from Thailand, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. However no such work was conducted in Cambodia or Lao PDR. Between 2010 and 2013, 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries. They were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-PCR assay. A total of 93 samples (4.7%) from 17 genera of bats tested positive. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus (αCoV) and beta-CoV (βCoV), respectively. The βCoVs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats (family Pteropodidae) (n=55) clustered with other bat βCoVs of lineage D, whereas one coronavirus from Pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage C of βCoVs which also includes the MERS-CoV. αCoVs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat αCoV sequences previously published.

31,Characterization of a novel species of adenovirus from Japanese microbat and role of CXADR as its entry factor,"Recently, bat adenoviruses (BtAdVs) of genus Mastadenovirus have been isolated from various bat species, some of them displaying a wide host range in cell culture. In this study, we isolated two BtAdVs from Japanese wild microbats. While one isolate was classified as Bat mastadenovirus A, the other was phylogenetically independent of other BtAdVs. It was rather related to, but serologically different from, canine adenoviruses. We propose that the latter, isolated from Asian parti-colored bat, should be assigned to a novel species of Bat mastadenovirus. Both isolates replicated in various mammalian cell lines, implying their wide cell tropism. To gain insight into cell tropism of these BtAdVs, we investigated the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) for virus entry to the cells. We prepared CXADR-knockout canine kidney cells and found that replication of BtAdVs was significantly hampered in these cells. For confirmation, their replication in canine CXADR-addback cells was rescued to the levels with the original cells. We also found that viral replication was corrected in human or bat CXADR-transduced cells to similar levels as in canine CXADR-addback cells. These results suggest that BtAdVs were able to use several mammalian-derived CXADRs as entry factors.","['1 Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', '2 Division of Global Epidemiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', '3 Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', '4 Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Bioresource Sciences, Nihon University, Fujisawa, Japan.', '5 Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. ahorimo@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']","Tomoya Kobayashi, Hiromichi Matsugo, Junki Maruyama, Haruhiko Kamiki, Ayato Takada, Ken Maeda, Akiko Takenaka-Uema, Yukinobu Tohya, Shin Murakami, Taisuke Horimoto, ",Scientific reports,2019,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30679679
32,Identification of novel bat coronaviruses sheds light on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses,"Despite the discovery of animal coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, the evolutionary origins of this virus are elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic study of 411 bat samples collected from a small geographical region in Yunnan province, China, between May 2019 and November 2020. We identified 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related and three SARS-CoV-related viruses. Rhinolophus pusillus virus RpYN06 was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in most of the genome, although it possessed a more divergent spike gene. The other three SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses carried a genetically distinct spike gene that could weakly bind to the hACE2 receptor in vitro. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species, with the largest contiguous hotspots extending from South Laos and Vietnam to southern China. Our study highlights the remarkable diversity of bat coronaviruses at the local scale, including close relatives of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.","['1 Key Laboratory of Etiology and Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Universities of Shandong, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Taian 271000, China.', '2 Landscape Ecology Group, Center for Integrative Conservation, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan 666303, China.', '3 CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, CAS Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning (CASCIRE), CAS-TWAS Center of Excellence for Emerging Infectious Diseases (CEEID), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', '4 Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', '5 CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, CAS Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning (CASCIRE), CAS-TWAS Center of Excellence for Emerging Infectious Diseases (CEEID), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; Institute of Physical Science and Information, Anhui University, Hefei 230039, China.', '6 Landscape Ecology Group, Center for Integrative Conservation, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan 666303, China; Center of Conservation Biology, Core Botanical Gardens, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan 666303, China.

33,Extensive diversity of coronaviruses in bats from China,"To help reveal the diversity and evolution of bat coronaviruses we collected 1067 bats from 21 species in China. A total of 73 coronaviruses (32 alphacoronaviruses and 41 betacoronaviruses) were identified in these bats, with an overall prevalence of 6.84%. All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Overall, these data suggest that high contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of coronaviruses.","['1 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China.', '3 Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', '4 Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, Guizhou Province, China.', '5 Longquan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Longquan, Zhejiang Province, China.', '6 Neixiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Neixiang, Henan Province, China.', '7 Jiyuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jiyuan, Henan Province, China.', '8 Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', '9 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China.

34,Genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses and comparative genetic analysis of MERS-related coronaviruses in South Korea,"Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir of several potentially zoonotic viruses, including Lyssavirus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV). Here, we performed a molecular epidemiological investigation of South Korean bat viruses. Genetic comparative analysis was performed on the spike glycoprotein gene of the detected MERS-related CoVs. Among 1640 samples (348 oral swabs, 1199 faecal samples, 83 urine samples and 10 bat carcass) collected across 24 South Korean provinces during 2017-2019, CoV was detected in 82 samples (75 faeces and seven oral swab samples) from 11 provinces. Surveillance over the 3 years during which samples were collected revealed significantly higher CoV detection rates between spring and autumn, and a high detection rate in Vespertillionidae and Rhinolophidae bats. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Korean bat CoVs are genetically diverse regardless of their spatiotemporal distribution and their host species, and that the discovered bat CoVs belong to various subgenera within the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera. Twenty detected MERS-related CoVs belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus were similar to the Ia io bat CoV NL140422 and NL13845 strains. A comprehensive genetic analysis of two Korean bat MERS-related CoV spike receptor binding domain (RBDs) (176 and 267 strains) showed that the 18 critical residues that are involved in interactions with the human DPP4 receptor are most similar to the NL13845 strain, which is known to not bind with hDPP4. A deeper analysis of the interfacing residues in the Korean bat MERS-related CoVs RBD-hDPP4 complexes showed that the Korean bat CoVs has fewer polar contacts than the NL13845 strain. Although further study will be needed, these results suggest that Korean bat MERS-related CoVs are unlikely to bind with hDPP4. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring to identifying the origin of new infectious diseases, specifically mutant CoV.","['1 Laboratory of Veterinary Infectious Disease, College of Veterinary Medicine, Jeonbuk National University, Iksan, Republic of Korea.', '2 Department of Life Science, Dongguk University, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea.', '3 Wildlife Disease Response Team, National Institution of Wildlife Disease Control and Prevention, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.']","Sook-Young Lee, Chul-Un Chung, Jun Soo Park, Yoon Ji Kim, Young-Sik Kim, Eun-Jee Na, YongKwan Kim, Jae-Ku Oem, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,NO_DATE,Middle East respiratory syndrome; bat; coronavirus; genetic diversity; phylogenetic analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536059
35,Virome profiling of bats from Myanmar by metagenomic analysis of tissue samples reveals more novel Mammalian viruses,"Bats are reservoir animals harboring many important pathogenic viruses and with the capability of transmitting these to humans and other animals. To establish an effective surveillance to monitor transboundary spread of bat viruses between Myanmar and China, complete organs from the thorax and abdomen from 853 bats of six species from two Myanmar counties close to Yunnan province, China, were collected and tested for their virome through metagenomics by Solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. In total, 3,742,314 reads of 114 bases were generated, and over 86% were assembled into 1,649,512 contigs with an average length of 114 bp, of which 26,698 (2%) contigs were recognizable viral sequences belonging to 24 viral families. Of the viral contigs 45% (12,086/26,698) were related to vertebrate viruses, 28% (7,443/26,698) to insect viruses, 27% (7,074/26,698) to phages and 95 contigs to plant viruses. The metagenomic results were confirmed by PCR of selected viruses in all bat samples followed by phylogenetic analysis, which has led to the discovery of some novel bat viruses of the genera Mamastrovirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, Iflavirus and Orthohepadnavirus and to their prevalence rates in two bat species. In conclusion, the present study aims to present the bat virome in Myanmar, and the results obtained further expand the spectrum of viruses harbored by bats.","['1 Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China.']","Biao He, Zuosheng Li, Fanli Yang, Junfeng Zheng, Ye Feng, Huancheng Guo, Yingying Li, Yiyin Wang, Nan Su, Fuqiang Zhang, Quanshui Fan, Changchun Tu, ",PloS one,2013,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23630620
36,Discovery and Characterization of Novel Bat Coronavirus Lineages from Kazakhstan,"Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a variety of hosts, resulting in a range of symptoms from gastrointestinal illness to respiratory distress. Bats are reservoirs for a high diversity of coronaviruses, and focused surveillance detected several strains genetically similar to MERS-coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus, and the human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. The bat fauna of central Asia, which link China to eastern Europe, are relatively less studied than other regions of the world. Kazakhstan is the world's ninth largest country; however, little is understood about the prevalence and diversity of bat-borne viruses. In this study, bat guano was collected from bat caves in three different sites of southern Kazakhstan that tested positive for coronaviruses. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates these are novel bat coronaviruses that belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. In addition, two distinct lineages of Kazakhstan bat coronaviruses were detected. Both lineages are closely related to bat coronaviruses from China, France, Spain, and South Africa, suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions. Our study highlights the need for collaborative efforts in understudied countries to increase integrated surveillance capabilities toward better monitoring and detection of infectious diseases.","['1 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. ian.mendenhall@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '2 Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, 080409 Gvardeiskiy, Kordaiskiy rayon, Zhambylskaya oblast, Kazakhstan. aslan_kerim@mail.ru.', '3 Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, 080409 Gvardeiskiy, Kordaiskiy rayon, Zhambylskaya oblast, Kazakhstan. vstrochkov@gmail.com.', '4 Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, 080409 Gvardeiskiy, Kordaiskiy rayon, Zhambylskaya oblast, Kazakhstan. sultankul70@mail.ru.', '5 Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, 080409 Gvardeiskiy, Kordaiskiy rayon, Zhambylskaya oblast, Kazakhstan. kopeyev85@mail.ru.', '6 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. yvonne.su@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '7 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore. gavin.smith@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '8 SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute, SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre, Singapore 168753, Singapore. gavin.smith@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '9 Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA. gavin.smith@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '10 Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, 080409 Gvardeiskiy, Kordaiskiy rayon, Zhambylskaya oblast, Kazakhstan. omb65@mail.ru.']","Ian H Mendenhall, Aslan A Kerimbayev, Vitaliy M Strochkov, Kulyaisan T Sultankulova, Syrym K Kopeyev, Yvonne C F Su, Gavin J D Smith, Mukhit B Orynbayev, ",Viruses,2019,Hypsugo savii; Kazakhstan; Myotis blythii; coronavirus; phylogeny; virus discovery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30999711
37,Identification of a Lineage D Betacoronavirus in Cave Nectar Bats (Eonycteris spelaea) in Singapore and an Overview of Lineage D Reservoir Ecology in SE Asian Bats,"Coronaviruses are a diverse group of viruses that infect mammals and birds. Bats are reservoirs for several different coronaviruses in the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. They also appear to be the natural reservoir for the ancestral viruses that generated the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we detected coronavirus sequences in next-generation sequence data created from Eonycteris spelaea faeces and urine. We also screened by PCR urine samples, faecal samples and rectal swabs collected from six species of bats in Singapore between 2011 and 2014, all of which were negative. The phylogenetic analysis indicates this novel strain is most closely related to lineage D Betacoronaviruses detected in a diverse range of bat species. This is the second time that coronaviruses have been detected in cave nectar bats, but the first coronavirus sequence data generated from this species. Bat species from which this group of coronaviruses has been detected are widely distributed across SE Asia, South Asia and Southern China. They overlap geographically, often share roosting sites and have been witnessed to forage on the same plant. The addition of sequence data from this group of viruses will allow us to better understand coronavirus evolution and host specificity.","['1 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', '2 College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', '3 Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore.', '4 Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK.', '5 National Parks Board, Singapore.', '6 School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.', '7 Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.']","I H Mendenhall, S Borthwick, E S Neves, D Low, M Linster, B Liang, M Skiles, J Jayakumar, H Han, V Gunalan, B P Y-H Lee, K Okahara, L-F Wang, S Maurer-Stroh, Y C F Su, G J D Smith, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,NO_DATE,disease ecology; distribution; evolution; virus diversity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27637887
38,Global patterns in coronavirus diversity,"Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence.","['1 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168 Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168 Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.', '3 EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34 Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.', '4 One Health Institute & Karen C Drayer Wildlife Health Center, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.', '5 Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168 Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.', '6 Metabiota, Inc.

Recent studies have reported astroviruses in bats in Europe and in several locations in China. We sampled 1876 bats from 17 genera at 45 sites from 14 and 13 provinces in Cambodia and Lao PDR respectively, and tested them for astroviruses. Our study revealed a high diversity of astroviruses among various Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera bats. Evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses in bats was found. Furthermore, additional Pteropodid hosts were detected. The astroviruses formed distinct phylogenetic clusters within the genus Mamastrovirus, most closely related to other known bat astroviruses. The astrovirus sequences were found to be highly saturated indicating that phylogenetic relationships should be interpreted carefully. An astrovirus clustering in a group with other viruses from diverse hosts, including from ungulates and porcupines, was found in a Rousettus bat. These findings suggest that diverse astroviruses can be found in many species of mammals, including bats.","['1 Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Virology Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.', '2 National Veterinary Research Institute, Department of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, Cambodia.', '3 Forest Administration, Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, Cambodia.', '4 Wildlife Conservation Society, Cambodia.', ""5 Institut de Systématique, Evolution, Biodiversité (ISYEB), UMR 7205 MNHN CNRS UPMC, EPHE, Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, France; Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Institut de Systématique, Evolution, Biodiversité (ISYEB), UMR 7205 MNHN CNRS UPMC, France."", '6 National Animal Health Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, Laos.', '7 Wildlife Conservation Society, Laos; Metabiota Inc., Vientiane, Laos.', '8 Wildlife Conservation Society, Laos.', '9 Institute of Physical Geography, Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', '10 Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Health Program, Bronx, N.Y., USA.', '11 One Health Institute, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, USA.', '12 Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Health Program, Bronx, N.Y., USA; Metabiota Inc., Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada.', '13 Cirad, UMR 17, Cirad-Ird, TA-A17/G, Montpellier, France; Université de Montpellier, IES, UMR 5214, CNRS-UM, Montpellier, France.

40,Coexistence of multiple coronaviruses in several bat colonies in an abandoned mineshaft,"Since the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak prompted a search for the natural reservoir of the SARS coronavirus, numerous alpha- and betacoronaviruses have been discovered in bats around the world. Bats are likely the natural reservoir of alpha- and betacoronaviruses, and due to the rich diversity and global distribution of bats, the number of bat coronaviruses will likely increase. We conducted a surveillance of coronaviruses in bats in an abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, China, from 2012-2013. Six bat species were frequently detected in the cave: Rhinolophus sinicus, Rhinolophus affinis, Hipposideros pomona, Miniopterus schreibersii, Miniopterus fuliginosus, and Miniopterus fuscus. By sequencing PCR products of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp), we found a high frequency of infection by a diverse group of coronaviruses in different bat species in the mineshaft. Sequenced partial RdRp fragments had 80%-99% nucleic acid sequence identity with well-characterized Alphacoronavirus species, including BtCoV HKU2, BtCoV HKU8, and BtCoV1, and unassigned species BtCoV HKU7 and BtCoV HKU10. Additionally, the surveillance identified two unclassified betacoronaviruses, one new strain of SARS-like coronavirus, and one potentially new betacoronavirus species. Furthermore, coronavirus co-infection was detected in all six bat species, a phenomenon that fosters recombination and promotes the emergence of novel virus strains. Our findings highlight the importance of bats as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and the potentially zoonotic source of viral pathogens.","['1 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China.', '2 Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Control and Prevention, Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention, Dali, 671000, China.', '3 School of Public Health, Dali University, Dali, 671000, China.', '4 Mojiang Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Mojiang, 654800, China.', '5 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.']","Xing-Yi Ge, Ning Wang, Wei Zhang, Ben Hu, Bei Li, Yun-Zhi Zhang, Ji-Hua Zhou, Chu-Ming Luo, Xing-Lou Yang, Li-Jun Wu, Bo Wang, Yun Zhang, Zong-Xiao Li, Zheng-Li Shi, ",Virologica Sinica,NO_DATE,bat; coinfection; coronavirus; mineshaft.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26920708
41,Bat coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and infectious for human cells,"The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown despite reports of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Asian Rhinolophus bats1-4, including the closest virus from R. affinis, RaTG13 (refs. 5,6), and pangolins7-9. SARS-CoV-2 has a mosaic genome, to which different progenitors contribute. The spike sequence determines the binding affinity and accessibility of its receptor-binding domain to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is responsible for host range10-12. SARS-CoV-2 progenitor bat viruses genetically close to SARS-CoV-2 and able to enter human cells through a human ACE2 (hACE2) pathway have not yet been identified, although they would be key in understanding the origin of the epidemic. Here we show that such viruses circulate in cave bats living in the limestone karstic terrain in northern Laos, in the Indochinese peninsula. We found that the receptor-binding domains of these viruses differ from that of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two residues at the interface with ACE2, bind more efficiently to the hACE2 protein than that of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Wuhan from early human cases, and mediate hACE2-dependent entry and replication in human cells, which is inhibited by antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. None of these bat viruses contains a furin cleavage site in the spike protein. Our findings therefore indicate that bat-borne SARS-CoV-2-like viruses that are potentially infectious for humans circulate in Rhinolophus spp. in the Indochinese peninsula.","['1 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Pathogen Discovery Laboratory, Paris, France.', '2 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, The OIE Collaborating Center for the Detection and Identification in Humans of Emerging Animal Pathogens, Paris, France.', ""3 Institut Pasteur du Laos, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '4 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, CNRS UMR 3569, Structural Virology Unit, Paris, France.', '5 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, CNRS UMR 3569, Molecular Genetics of RNA Viruses Unit, Paris, France.', '6 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, CNRS UMR 3528, Structural Bioinformatics Unit, Paris, France.', ""7 Faculty of Environmental Sciences, National University of Laos, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '8 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses, Paris, France.', '9 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Bioinformatic and Biostatistic Hub - Computational Biology Department, Paris, France.', '10 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, Pathogen Discovery Laboratory, Paris, France. marc.eloit@pasteur.fr.', '11 Institut Pasteur, Université de Paris, The OIE Collaborating Center for the Detection and Identification in Humans of Emerging Animal Pathogens, Paris, France. marc.eloit@pasteur.fr.', ""12 Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d'Alfort, University of Paris-Est, Maisons-Alfort, France. marc.eloit@pasteur.fr.""]","Sarah Temmam, Khamsing Vongphayloth, Eduard Baquero, Sandie Munier, Massimiliano Bonomi, Béatrice Regnault, Bounsavane Douangboubpha, Yasaman Karami, Delphine Chrétien, Daosavanh Sanamxay, Vilakhan Xayaphet, Phetphoumin Paphaphanh, Vincent Lacoste, Somphavanh Somlor, Khaithong Lakeomany, Nothasin Phommavanh, Philippe Pérot, Océane Dehan, Faustine Amara, Flora Donati, Thomas Bigot, Michael Nilges, Félix A Rey, Sylvie van der Werf, Paul T Brey, Marc Eloit, ",Nature,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35172323
42,Characterization of a New Member of Alphacoronavirus with Unique Genomic Features in Rhinolophus Bats,"Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir of a variety of coronaviruses (CoVs). Several of them have caused diseases in humans and domestic animals by interspecies transmission. Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance. In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features. Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses. One unique gene at the 3' end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus. Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-β production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-κB production. We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells. Our results expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses. Continuous screening of bat viruses will help us further understand the important role played by bats in coronavirus evolution and transmission.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. wuzhongxiaoliu@163.com.', '2 College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100864, China. wuzhongxiaoliu@163.com.', '3 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. chine.lcm@163.com.', '4 College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100864, China. chine.lcm@163.com.', '5 Center for Emerging Infectious Disease, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. liuhz@wh.iov.cn.', '6 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. yangxl@wh.iov.cn.', '7 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. ouihaagendazs@hotmail.com.', '8 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. happyzhang_2007@163.com.', '9 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. shenqi0622@126.com.', '10 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. zhuyan@wh.iov.cn.', '11 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10001, USA. zhugj609@126.com.', '12 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. pukulovesu@163.com.', '13 College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100864, China. pukulovesu@163.com.', '14 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. pengcheng@wh.iov.cn.', '15 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.']","Ning Wang, Chuming Luo, Haizhou Liu, Xinglou Yang, Ben Hu, Wei Zhang, Bei Li, Yan Zhu, Guangjian Zhu, Xurui Shen, Cheng Peng, Zhengli Shi, ",Viruses,2019,Rhinolophus bat; alphacoronavirus; coronavirus; unique genes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31022925
43,Diversity of coronavirus in bats from Eastern Thailand,"Background:
        
      
      Bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses (CoVs), including those closely related to human pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV. There are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. Findings:
        
      
      A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at -80°C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and Megaderma lyra. Conclusions:
        
      
      CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand. Further characterization of additional CoV genes may be useful to better describe the CoV divergence.","['1 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. spwa@hotmail.com.', '2 Faculty of Forestry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. prateepd@hotmail.com.', '3 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. wava_38@hotmail.com.', '4 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. thongchai_ae@hotmail.com.', '5 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand. lotterwildlifevet@gmail.com.', '6 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand. kbudsabong@yahoo.com.', '7 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. sangchai59@hotmail.com.', '8 Inter-Department Program of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. sangchai59@hotmail.com.', '9 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. n.sittidetboripat@gmail.com.', '10 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand. poom_forest@hotmail.com.', '11 Faculty of Forestry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. rdispk@ku.ac.th.', '12 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand. iamapisit@gmail.com.', '13 Royal Forest Department, Bangkok, Thailand. kumron57@gmail.com.', '14 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. siriporn.ghai@gmail.com.', '15 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA. epstein@ecohealthalliance.org.', '16 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA. daszak@ecohealthalliance.org.', '17 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA. olival@ecohealthalliance.org.', '18 Naval Medical Research Center-Asia, Singapore, Singapore. patricknhrc@gmail.com.', '19 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. mvcallahan@mgh.harvard.edu.', '20 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. mvcallahan@mgh.harvard.edu.', '21 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. fmedthm@gmail.com.']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Prateep Duengkae, Apaporn Rodpan, Thongchai Kaewpom, Patarapol Maneeorn, Budsabong Kanchanasaka, Sangchai Yingsakmongkon, Nuntaporn Sittidetboripat, Chaiyaporn Chareesaen, Nathawat Khlangsap, Apisit Pidthong, Kumron Leadprathom, Siriporn Ghai, Jonathan H Epstein, Peter Daszak, Kevin J Olival, Patrick J Blair, Michael V Callahan, Thiravat Hemachudha, ",Virology journal,2015,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25884446
44,Origin and cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses in China,"Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. Here we use a Bayesian statistical framework and a large sequence data set from bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) in China to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission and dispersal. We find that host-switching occurs more frequently and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha- than beta-CoVs, and is more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.","['1 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA.', '2 Wildlife Conservation Society, Viet Nam Country Program, Ha Noi, Viet Nam; Wildlife Conservation Society, Health Program, Bronx, NY, USA.', '3 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens And Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '4 Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.', '5 School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', '6 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '7 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens And Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.', '8 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA. daszak@ecohealthalliance.org.']","Alice Latinne, Ben Hu, Kevin J Olival, Guangjian Zhu, Libiao Zhang, Hongying Li, Aleksei A Chmura, Hume E Field, Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio, Jonathan H Epstein, Bei Li, Wei Zhang, Lin-Fa Wang, Zheng-Li Shi, Peter Daszak, ",Nature communications,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843626
45,A Novel Bat Coronavirus Closely Related to SARS-CoV-2 Contains Natural Insertions at the S1/S2 Cleavage Site of the Spike Protein,"The unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China and beyond has had major public health impacts on a global scale [1, 2]. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [3], the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomic analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses.","['1 Key Laboratory of Etiology and Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Universities of Shandong, Shandong First Medical University, and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Taian 271000, China.', '2 Landscape Ecology Group, Center for Integrative Conservation, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan 666303, China.', '3 Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', '4 Computational Virology Group, Center for Bacteria and Virus Resources and Bioinformation, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.', '5 CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, CAS Center for Influenza Research and Early-Warning (CASCIRE), CAS-TWAS Center of Excellence for Emerging Infectious Diseases (CEEID), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', '6 Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and School of Medical Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', '7 Landscape Ecology Group, Center for Integrative Conservation, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Menglun, Mengla, Yunnan 666303, China.

46,"Discovery, diversity and evolution of novel coronaviruses sampled from rodents in China","Although rodents are important reservoirs for RNA viruses, to date only one species of rodent coronavirus (CoV) has been identified. Herein, we describe a new CoV, denoted Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), and novel variants of two Betacoronavirus species termed Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus (LAMV) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV), that were identified in a survey of 1465 rodents sampled in China during 2011-2013. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LAMV and LRLV fell into lineage A of the genus Betacoronavirus, which included CoVs discovered in humans and domestic and wild animals. In contrast, LRNV harbored by Rattus norvegicus formed a distinct lineage within the genus Alphacoronavirus in the 3CL(pro), RdRp, and Hel gene trees, but formed a more divergent lineage in the N and S gene trees, indicative of a recombinant origin. Additional recombination events were identified in LRLV. Together, these data suggest that rodents may carry additional unrecognized CoVs.","['1 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.', '2 Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', '3 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China.', '4 Longquan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Longquan, Zhejiang Province, China.', '5 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Marie Bashir Institute of Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Biological Sciences and Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia.', '6 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, China.

47,Longitudinal study of age-specific pattern of coronavirus infection in Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Thailand,"Background:
        
      
      Bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) (mainly Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus). Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei)'s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. Methods:
        
      
      P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January-December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results:
        
      
      CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). Conclusions:
        
      
      The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.","['1 Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases - Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, Chulalongkorn Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. spwa@hotmail.com.', '2 Faculty of Forestry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '3 Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases - Health Science Centre, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, Chulalongkorn Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '4 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '5 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand.']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Prateep Duengkae, Aingorn Chaiyes, Thongchai Kaewpom, Apaporn Rodpan, Sangchai Yingsakmongkon, Sininat Petcharat, Patcharakiti Phengsakul, Pattarapol Maneeorn, Thiravat Hemachudha, ",Virology journal,2018,Chiroptera; Coronavirus; Pteropus; Thailand.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463282
48,Novel astroviruses in insectivorous bats,"Bats are increasingly recognized to harbor a wide range of viruses, and in most instances these viruses appear to establish long-term persistence in these animals. They are the reservoir of a number of human zoonotic diseases including Nipah, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We report the identification of novel groups of astroviruses in apparently healthy insectivorous bats found in Hong Kong, in particular, bats belonging to the genera Miniopterus and Myotis. Astroviruses are important causes of diarrhea in many animal species, including humans. Many of the bat astroviruses form distinct phylogenetic clusters in the genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae. Virus detection rates of 36% to 100% and 50% to 70% were found in Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus bats, respectively, captured within a single bat habitat during four consecutive visits spanning 1 year. There was high genetic diversity of viruses in bats found within this single habitat. Some bat astroviruses may be phylogenetically related to human astroviruses, and further studies with a wider range of bat species in different geographic locations are warranted. These findings are likely to provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of astroviruses and reinforce the role of bats as a reservoir of viruses with potential to pose a zoonotic threat to human health.","['1 Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']","D K W Chu, L L M Poon, Y Guan, J S M Peiris, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18550669
49,A strategy to estimate unknown viral diversity in mammals,"The majority of emerging zoonoses originate in wildlife, and many are caused by viruses. However, there are no rigorous estimates of total viral diversity (here termed ""virodiversity"") for any wildlife species, despite the utility of this to future surveillance and control of emerging zoonoses. In this case study, we repeatedly sampled a mammalian wildlife host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens (the Indian Flying Fox, Pteropus giganteus) and used PCR with degenerate viral family-level primers to discover and analyze the occurrence patterns of 55 viruses from nine viral families. We then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in P. giganteus to be 58 viruses. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host. We used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families, assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses, with minimal turnover between host species. We estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be ~$6.3 billion (or ~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity), which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses. Importance:
        
      
      Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in viral discovery efforts. However, most lack rigorous systematic design, which limits our ability to understand viral diversity and its ecological drivers and reduces their value to public health intervention. Here, we present a new framework for the discovery of novel viruses in wildlife and use it to make the first-ever estimate of the number of viruses that exist in a mammalian host. As pathogens continue to emerge from wildlife, this estimate allows us to put preliminary bounds around the potential size of the total zoonotic pool and facilitates a better understanding of where best to allocate resources for the subsequent discovery of global viral diversity.","['1 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. sja2127@columbia.edu']","Simon J Anthony, Jonathan H Epstein, Kris A Murray, Isamara Navarrete-Macias, Carlos M Zambrana-Torrelio, Alexander Solovyov, Rafael Ojeda-Flores, Nicole C Arrigo, Ariful Islam, Shahneaz Ali Khan, Parviez Hosseini, Tiffany L Bogich, Kevin J Olival, Maria D Sanchez-Leon, William B Karesh, Tracey Goldstein, Stephen P Luby, Stephen S Morse, Jonna A K Mazet, Peter Daszak, W Ian Lipkin, ",mBio,2013,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24003179

52,Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus & Rousettus species of bats from different States of India,"Background & objectives:
        
      
      Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens. In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods:
        
      
      Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results:
        
      
      Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation & conclusions:
        
      
      This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them.

54,"Genetic characterization of Yokose virus, a flavivirus isolated from the bat in Japan","Yokose virus (strain Oita-36) was isolated from the bat in Japan in 1971. In the present study, we determined complete nucleotide sequences of Yokose virus using RT-PCR and RACE techniques. Yokose virus genome consists of 10,857 nucleotides in length (accession no. AB114858), containing a single open reading frame (3425 amino acids) encoding 11 viral proteins. We deduced the boundaries of each protein in the polyprotein sequence according to the protein cleavage sites of other flaviviruses. The nucleotide sequences of the 5' and 3' nontranslated region (NTR) and amino acid sequences of individual proteins of the virus were compared with those of six other flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue-2 virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Rio Bravo virus or Modoc virus. Yokose virus demonstrated the highest similarity to yellow fever virus. Yokose virus also has CS1 motif, which are well-conserved specifically in mosquito-born flaviviruses, in its 3' NTR. When a part of the NS5 amino acid sequence (345 amino acids) was compared with those of other four flaviviruses, Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus, Sepik virus, and yellow fever virus, the three former viruses are more closely related to Yokose virus than yellow fever virus. Human sera from dengue-virus-infected case and yellow fever vaccine reacted with the viral proteins. Moreover, human serum from a yellow fever vaccine weakly neutralized Yokose virus. Our results suggest that there are cross-reactive antigenicities among Yokose virus and other flaviviruses.","['1 Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 1-23-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan.']","Shigeru Tajima, Tomohiko Takasaki, Shigeo Matsuno, Mikio Nakayama, Ichiro Kurane, ",Virology,2005,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15661139

59,The Epidemiological Characteristics of the Korean Bat Paramyxovirus between 2016 and 2019,"Bats are considered reservoirs of severe emerging human pathogens. Notably, bats host major mammalian paramyxoviruses from the family Paramyxoviridae, order Mononegavirales. In this study, paramyxoviruses were investigated by reverse transcription semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-semi-nested PCR) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), based on the RT-semi-nested PCR using the consensus paramyxovirus primers targeting the RNA dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) region. In addition, RT-PCR was performed using newly designed primers targeting regions of the fusion protein (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN). The dominant bat species in the collection site of paramyxoviruses were Miniopterus schreibersii, Myotis macrodactylus, Myotis petax, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. Paramyxoviruses were detected in four samples in 2016 and six in 2019. Meanwhile, in samples collected in 2017 and 2018, no paramyxoviruses were detected. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial nucleotide sequences of RdRp, F, and HN proteins suggested that the viruses belonged to the proposed genus Shaanvirus.

Comparative genome analysis showed that the various open reading frames (ORFs) of the genomes of the three coronaviruses had significantly higher amino acid identities to those of other group 2 coronaviruses than group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid all showed that the group 2a and 2b and putative group 2c and 2d coronaviruses are more closely related to each other than to group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Unique genomic features distinguishing between these four subgroups, including the number of papain-like proteases, the presence or absence of hemagglutinin esterase, small ORFs between the membrane and nucleocapsid genes and ORFs (NS7a and NS7b), bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures downstream of the nucleocapsid gene, transcription regulatory sequence, and ribosomal recognition signal for the envelope gene, were also observed. This is the first time that NS7a and NS7b downstream of the nucleocapsid gene has been found in a group 2 coronavirus. The high Ka/Ks ratio of NS7a and NS7b in bat-CoV HKU9 implies that these two group 2d-specific genes are under high selective pressure and hence are rapidly evolving. The four subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses probably originated from a common ancestor. Further molecular epidemiological studies on coronaviruses in the bats of other countries, as well as in other animals, and complete genome sequencing will shed more light on coronavirus diversity and their evolutionary histories.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, University Pathology Building, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']","Patrick C Y Woo, Ming Wang, Susanna K P Lau, Huifang Xu, Rosana W S Poon, Rongtong Guo, Beatrice H L Wong, Kai Gao, Hoi-Wah Tsoi, Yi Huang, Kenneth S M Li, Carol S F Lam, Kwok-Hung Chan, Bo-Jian Zheng, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17121802

62,Evolutionary insights into the ecology of coronaviruses,"Although many novel members of the Coronaviridae have recently been recognized in different species, the ecology of coronaviruses has not been established. Our study indicates that bats harbor a much wider diversity of coronaviruses than any other animal species. Dating of different coronavirus lineages suggests that bat coronaviruses are older than those recognized in other animals and that the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was directly derived from viruses from wild animals in wet markets of southern China. Furthermore, the most closely related bat and SARS coronaviruses diverged in 1986, an estimated divergence time of 17 years prior to the outbreak, suggesting that there may have been transmission via an unknown intermediate host. Analysis of lineage-specific selection pressure also indicated that only SARS coronaviruses in civets and humans were under significant positive selection, also demonstrating a recent interspecies transmission. Analysis of population dynamics revealed that coronavirus populations in bats have constant population growth, while viruses from all other hosts show epidemic-like increases in population. These results indicate that diverse coronaviruses are endemic in different bat species, with repeated introductions to other animals and occasional establishment in other species. Our findings suggest that bats are likely the natural hosts for all presently known coronavirus lineages and that all coronaviruses recognized in other species were derived from viruses residing in bats. Further surveillance of bat and other animal populations is needed to fully describe the ecology and evolution of this virus family.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine Building, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.']","D Vijaykrishna, G J D Smith, J X Zhang, J S M Peiris, H Chen, Y Guan, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267506
63,Complete genome analysis of three novel picornaviruses from diverse bat species,"Although bats are important reservoirs of diverse viruses that can cause human epidemics, little is known about the presence of picornaviruses in these flying mammals. Among 1,108 bats of 18 species studied, three novel picornaviruses (groups 1, 2, and 3) were identified from alimentary specimens of 12 bats from five species and four genera. Two complete genomes, each from the three picornaviruses, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they fell into three distinct clusters in the Picornaviridae family, with low homologies to known picornaviruses, especially in leader and 2A proteins. Moreover, group 1 and 2 viruses are more closely related to each other than to group 3 viruses, which exhibit genome features distinct from those of the former two virus groups. In particular, the group 3 virus genome contains the shortest leader protein within Picornaviridae, a putative type I internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5'-untranslated region instead of the type IV IRES found in group 1 and 2 viruses, one instead of two GXCG motifs in 2A, an L→V substitution in the DDLXQ motif in 2C helicase, and a conserved GXH motif in 3C protease. Group 1 and 2 viruses are unique among picornaviruses in having AMH instead of the GXH motif in 3C(pro). These findings suggest that the three picornaviruses belong to two novel genera in the Picornaviridae family. This report describes the discovery and complete genome analysis of three picornaviruses in bats, and their presence in diverse bat genera/species suggests the ability to cross the species barrier.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, University Pathology Building, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']","Susanna K P Lau, Patrick C Y Woo, Kenneth K Y Lai, Yi Huang, Cyril C Y Yip, Chung-Tong Shek, Paul Lee, Carol S F Lam, Kwok-Hung Chan, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21697464

65,Genomic Characterization of Diverse Bat Coronavirus HKU10 in Hipposideros Bats,"Bats have been identified as natural reservoirs of a variety of coronaviruses. They harbor at least 19 of the 33 defined species of alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Previously, the bat coronavirus HKU10 was found in two bat species of different suborders, Rousettus leschenaultia and Hipposideros pomona, in south China. However, its geographic distribution and evolution history are not fully investigated. Here, we screened this viral species by a nested reverse transcriptase PCR in our archived samples collected over 10 years from 25 provinces of China and one province of Laos. From 8004 bat fecal samples, 26 were found to be positive for bat coronavirus HKU10 (BtCoV HKU10). New habitats of BtCoV HKU10 were found in the Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hainan Provinces of China, and Louang Namtha Province in Laos. In addition to H. pomona, BtCoV HKU10 variants were found circulating in Aselliscus stoliczkanus and Hipposideros larvatus. We sequenced full-length genomes of 17 newly discovered BtCoV HKU10 strains and compared them with previously published sequences. Our results revealed a much higher genetic diversity of BtCoV HKU10, particularly in spike genes and accessory genes. Besides the two previously reported lineages, we found six novel lineages in their new habitats, three of which were located in Yunnan province. The genotypes of these viruses are closely related to sampling locations based on polyproteins, and correlated to bat species based on spike genes. Combining phylogenetic analysis, selective pressure, and molecular-clock calculation, we demonstrated that Yunnan bats harbor a gene pool of BtCoV HKU10, with H. pomona as a natural reservoir. The cell tropism test using spike-pseudotyped lentivirus system showed that BtCoV HKU10 could enter cells from human and bat, suggesting a potential interspecies spillover. Continuous studies on these bat coronaviruses will expand our understanding of the evolution and genetic diversity of coronaviruses, and provide a prewarning of potential zoonotic diseases from bats.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100864, China.', '3 Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, China.', '4 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangzhou 510260, China.']","Ning Wang, Chu-Ming Luo, Xing-Lou Yang, Hai-Zhou Liu, Li-Biao Zhang, Wei Zhang, Bei Li, Yan Zhu, Cheng Peng, Zheng-Li Shi, Ben Hu, ",Viruses,2021,alphacoronavirus; bat coronavirus HKU10; coronavirus; interspecies transmission.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34696392
66,Discovery of Diverse Rodent and Bat Pestiviruses With Distinct Genomic and Phylogenetic Characteristics in Several Chinese Provinces,"Bats and rodents are widely distributed worldwide and can be native or intermediate reservoirs of many important zoonotic viruses. Pestiviruses are a group of virus species of the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae that can infect a wide variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and ruminants. Two classic types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild-to-severe disease in bovine and swine hosts, respectively, and cause tremendous economic losses in these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses and an atypical porcine pestivirus, which cause disease in piglets, showed a close genetic relationship with a specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different locations by analyzing the available bat and rodent virome data from throughout China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are distinct from other known viruses were identified and sequenced. These viruses were identified from two bat species and four rodent species in different Chinese provinces. There were two distinct lineages present in these viruses, that differ from artiodactylous pestivirus. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactylous hosts.

      Yokose virus was first isolated from bats (Miniopterus fuliginosus) collected in Yokosuka, Japan, in 1971, and is a new member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. In this study, we isolated a Yokose virus from a serum sample of Myotis daubentonii (order Chiroptera, family Vespertilionidae) collected in Yunnan province, China in 2013. Methods:
        
      
      The serum specimens of bat were used to inoculate in BHK-21 and Vero E6 cells for virus isolation. Then the viral complete genome sequence was obtained and was used for phylogenetic analysis performed by BEAST software package. Results:
        
      
      The virus was shown to have cytopathic effects in mammalian cells (BHK-21 and Vero E6). Genome sequencing indicated that it has a single open reading frame (ORF), with a genome of 10,785 nucleotides in total. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome suggests that XYBX1332 is a Yokose virus (YOKV) of the genus Flavivirus. Nucleotide and amino acid homology levels of the ORF of XYBX1332 and Oita-36, the original strain of YOKV, were 72 and 82%, respectively. The ORFs of XYBX1332 and Oita-36 encode 3422 and 3425 amino acids, respectively. In addition, the non-coding regions (5'- and 3'-untranslated regions [UTRs]) of these two strains differ in length and the homology of the 5'- and 3'-UTRs was 81.5 and 78.3%, respectively. Conclusion:
        
      
      The isolation of YOKV (XYBX1332) from inland China thousands of kilometers from Yokosuka, Japan, suggests that the geographical distribution of YOKV is not limited to the islands of Japan and that it can also exist in the inland areas of Asia.

70,Detection and Characterization of Homologues of Human Hepatitis Viruses and Pegiviruses in Rodents and Bats in Vietnam,"Rodents and bats are now widely recognised as important sources of zoonotic virus infections in other mammals, including humans. Numerous surveys have expanded our knowledge of diverse viruses in a range of rodent and bat species, including their origins, evolution, and range of hosts. In this study of pegivirus and human hepatitis-related viruses, liver and serum samples from Vietnamese rodents and bats were examined by PCR and sequencing. Nucleic acids homologous to human hepatitis B, C, E viruses were detected in liver samples of 2 (1.3%) of 157 bats, 38 (8.1%), and 14 (3%) of 470 rodents, respectively. Hepacivirus-like viruses were frequently detected (42.7%) in the bamboo rat, Rhizomys pruinosus, while pegivirus RNA was only evident in 2 (0.3%) of 638 rodent serum samples. Complete or near-complete genome sequences of HBV, HEV and pegivirus homologues closely resembled those previously reported from rodents and bats. However, complete coding region sequences of the rodent hepacivirus-like viruses substantially diverged from all of the currently classified variants and potentially represent a new species in the Hepacivirus genus. Of the viruses identified, their routes of transmission and potential to establish zoonoses remain to be determined.","['1 Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK. dung.nguyen@ndm.ox.ac.uk.', '2 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam. cuongnv@oucru.org.', '3 Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK. david.bonsall@ndm.ox.ac.uk.', '4 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam. tuent@oucru.org.', '5 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam. jcarrique-mas@oucru.org.', '6 Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Oxford University, Oxford OX3 7FZ, UK. jcarrique-mas@oucru.org.', '7 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam. anhph@oucru.org.', '8 Fondation Mérieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), 69365 Lyon CEDEX 07, France. juliet.bryant@fondation-merieux.org.', '9 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam. gthwaites@oucru.org.', '10 Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Oxford University, Oxford OX3 7FZ, UK. gthwaites@oucru.org.', '11 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam. sbaker@oucru.org.', '12 Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Oxford University, Oxford OX3 7FZ, UK. sbaker@oucru.org.', '13 The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, UK. sbaker@oucru.org.', '14 Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, UK. mark.woolhouse@ed.ac.uk.', '15 Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK. peter.simmonds@ndm.ox.ac.uk.']","Dung Van Nguyen, Cuong Van Nguyen, David Bonsall, Tue Tri Ngo, Juan Carrique-Mas, Anh Hong Pham, Juliet E Bryant, Guy Thwaites, Stephen Baker, Mark Woolhouse, Peter Simmonds, ",Viruses,2018,Vietnam; bats; hepatitis viruses; homologues; pegiviruses; rodents.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29495551

72,Coexistence of different genotypes in the same bat and serological characterization of Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 belonging to a novel Betacoronavirus subgroup,"Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9), a recently identified coronavirus of novel Betacoronavirus subgroup D, from Leschenault's rousette, was previously found to display marked sequence polymorphism among genomes of four strains. Among 10 bats with complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes sequenced, three and two sequence clades for all three genes were codetected in two and five bats, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of two or three distinct genotypes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 in the same bat. Complete genome sequencing of the distinct genotypes from two bats, using degenerate/genome-specific primers with overlapping sequences confirmed by specific PCR, supported the coexistence of at least two distinct genomes in each bat. Recombination analysis using eight Ro-BatCoV HKU9 genomes showed possible recombination events between strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. Western blot assays using recombinant N proteins of Ro-BatCoV HKU9, Betacoronavirus subgroup A (HCoV-HKU1), subgroup B (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV), and subgroup C (Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5) coronaviruses were subgroup specific, supporting their classification as separate subgroups under Betacoronavirus. Antibodies were detected in 75 (43%) of 175 and 224 (64%) of 350 tested serum samples from Leschenault's rousette bats by Ro-BatCoV HKU9 N-protein-based Western blot and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. This is the first report describing coinfection of different coronavirus genotypes in bats and coronavirus genotypes of diverse nucleotide variation in the same host. Such unique phenomena, and the unusual instability of ORF7a, are likely due to recombination which may have been facilitated by the dense roosting behavior and long foraging range of Leschenault's rousette.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, University Pathology Building, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']","Susanna K P Lau, Rosana W S Poon, Beatrice H L Wong, Ming Wang, Yi Huang, Huifang Xu, Rongtong Guo, Kenneth S M Li, Kai Gao, Kwok-Hung Chan, Bo-Jian Zheng, Patrick C Y Woo, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20702646
73,Discovery and Evolutionary Analysis of a Novel Bat-Borne Paramyxovirus,"Paramyxoviruses are a group of RNA viruses, such as mumps virus, measles virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Newcastle disease virus, and parainfluenza virus, usually transmitted by airborne droplets that are predominantly responsible for acute respiratory diseases. In this paper, we identified a novel paramyxovirus belonging to genus Jeilongvirus infecting 4/112 (3.6%) bats from two trapping sites of Hainan Province of China. In these animals, the viral RNA was detected exclusively in kidney tissues. This is the first full-length Jeilongvirus genome (18,095 nucleotides) from bats of genus Hipposideros, which exhibits a canonical genome organization and encodes SH and TM proteins. Results, based on phylogenic analysis and genetic distances, indicate that the novel paramyxovirus formed an independent lineage belonging to genus Jeilongvirus, representing, thus, a novel species. In addition, the virus-host macro-evolutionary analysis revealed that host-switching was not only a common co-phylogenetic event, but also a potential mechanism by which rats are infected by bat-origin Jeilongvirus through cross-species virus transmission, indicating a bat origin of the genus Jeilongvirus. Overall, our study broadens the viral diversity, geographical distribution, host range, and evolution of genus Jeilongvirus.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, China.', '2 Hainan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 570203, China.', '3 Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China.', '4 Research Units of Discovery of Unknown Bacteria and Function, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.']","Wentao Zhu, Yuyuan Huang, Xiaojie Yu, Haiyun Chen, Dandan Li, Libo Zhou, Qianni Huang, Liyun Liu, Jing Yang, Shan Lu, ",Viruses,2022,Jeilongvirus; bat; co-evolutionary; paramyxovirus; virus discovery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35215881

77,Discovery of Bat Coronaviruses through Surveillance and Probe Capture-Based Next-Generation Sequencing,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) of bat origin have caused two pandemics in this century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them.IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '3 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '4 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore linfa.wang@duke-nus.edu.sg peng.zhou@wh.iov.cn.', '5 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China linfa.wang@duke-nus.edu.sg peng.zhou@wh.iov.cn.']","Bei Li, Hao-Rui Si, Yan Zhu, Xing-Lou Yang, Danielle E Anderson, Zheng-Li Shi, Lin-Fa Wang, Peng Zhou, ",mSphere,2020,bat; coronavirus; enrichment; genome; next-generation sequencing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31996413

However, most bat adenoviruses have been identified on the basis of partial genome sequences, and knowledge on the evolution of bat adenoviruses remains limited. In this study, we isolated and characterized four novel adenoviruses from two distinct bat species, and their full-length genomes were sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that these isolates represented three distinct species of the genus Mastadenovirus. However, all isolates had an exceptionally low G+C content and relatively short genomes compared with other known mastadenoviruses. We further analysed the relationships among the G+C content, 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) representation and genome size in the family Adenoviridae. Our results revealed that the CpG representation in adenoviral genomes depends primarily on the level of methylation, and the genome size displayed significant positive correlations with both G+C content and CpG representation. Since ancestral adenoviruses are believed to have contained short genomes, those probably had a low G+C content, similar to the genomes of these bat strains. Our results suggest that bats are important natural reservoirs for adenoviruses and play important roles in the evolution of adenoviruses.","['1 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, PR China.', '2 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases of Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, PR China.', '3 Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Control and Prevention, Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention, Dali, PR China.', '4 Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resource, Guangzhou, PR China.']","Bing Tan, Xing-Lou Yang, Xing-Yi Ge, Cheng Peng, Hai-Zhou Liu, Yun-Zhi Zhang, Li-Biao Zhang, Zheng-Li Shi, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475035

A co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent cross-species transmission among bats from different species, genera, and families. Overall, these data suggest that there are likely few barriers to the cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses.","['1 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China.', '2 Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', '3 Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.', '4 Guizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guiyang, Guizhou Province, China.', '5 Longquan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Longquan, Zhejiang Province, China.', '6 Jiyuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Jiyuan, Henan Province, China.', '7 Neixiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Neixiang, Henan Province, China.', '8 School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', '9 State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '10 Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', '11 State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Department of Zoonoses, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping, Beijing, China.

Hantavirus RNA was detected in Pomona roundleaf bats (Hipposideros pomona) (family Hipposideridae), captured in Vietnam in 1997 and 1999, and in banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus) (family Vespertilionidae), captured in Côte d'Ivoire in 2011. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the full-length S- and partial M- and L-segment sequences using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, demonstrated that the newfound hantaviruses formed highly divergent lineages, comprising other recently recognized bat-borne hantaviruses in Sierra Leone and China. The detection of bat-associated hantaviruses opens a new era in hantavirology and provides insights into their evolutionary origins.","['1 Pacific Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Research, John A.

92,Evidence for SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses circulating in bats and pangolins in Southeast Asia,"Among the many questions unanswered for the COVID-19 pandemic are the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential role of intermediate animal host(s) in the early animal-to-human transmission. The discovery of RaTG13 bat coronavirus in China suggested a high probability of a bat origin. Here we report molecular and serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoVs) actively circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Whole genome sequences were obtained from five independent bats (Rhinolophus acuminatus) in a Thai cave yielding a single isolate (named RacCS203) which is most related to the RmYN02 isolate found in Rhinolophus malayanus in Yunnan, China. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were also detected in bats of the same colony and in a pangolin at a wildlife checkpoint in Southern Thailand. Antisera raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of RmYN02 was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that the RBD of RacCS203 or RmYN02 failed to bind ACE2. Although the origin of the virus remains unresolved, our study extended the geographic distribution of genetically diverse SC2r-CoVs from Japan and China to Thailand over a 4800-km range. Cross-border surveillance is urgently needed to find the immediate progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '2 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '3 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Bangkok, Thailand.', '4 Forest Biology Department, Faculty of Forestry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '5 Changchun Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun, China.', '6 Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonosis, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', '7 CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia.', '8 Biological Threat Reduction Program, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Virginia, USA.', '9 Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Centre, WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. fmedthm@gmail.com.', '10 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore. linfa.wang@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '11 SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute, Singapore, Singapore. linfa.wang@duke-nus.edu.sg.']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Chee Wah Tan, Patarapol Maneeorn, Prateep Duengkae, Feng Zhu, Yutthana Joyjinda, Thongchai Kaewpom, Wan Ni Chia, Weenassarin Ampoot, Beng Lee Lim, Kanthita Worachotsueptrakun, Vivian Chih-Wei Chen, Nutthinee Sirichan, Chanida Ruchisrisarod, Apaporn Rodpan, Kirana Noradechanon, Thanawadee Phaichana, Niran Jantarat, Boonchu Thongnumchaima, Changchun Tu, Gary Crameri, Martha M Stokes, Thiravat Hemachudha, Lin-Fa Wang, ",Nature communications,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33563978
93,Genetic characterization of Betacoronavirus lineage C viruses in bats reveals marked sequence divergence in the spike protein of pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 in Japanese pipistrelle: implications for the origin of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,"While the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is closely related to Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) in bats from Hong Kong, and other potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats from Africa, Europe, and America, its animal origin remains obscure. To better understand the role of bats in its origin, we examined the molecular epidemiology and evolution of lineage C betacoronaviruses among bats. Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 were detected in 29% and 25% of alimentary samples from lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively. Sequencing of their RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes revealed that MERS-CoV is more closely related to Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in RdRp (92.1% to 92.3% amino acid [aa] identity) but is more closely related to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 in S (66.8% to 67.4% aa identity) and N (71.9% to 72.3% aa identity). Although both viruses were under purifying selection, the S of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 displayed marked sequence polymorphisms and more positively selected sites than that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4, suggesting that Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may generate variants to occupy new ecological niches along with its host in diverse habitats. Molecular clock analysis showed that they diverged from a common ancestor with MERS-CoV at least several centuries ago. Although MERS-CoV may have diverged from potential lineage C betacoronaviruses in European bats more recently, these bat viruses were unlikely to be the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV. Intensive surveillance for lineage C betaCoVs in Pipistrellus and related bats with diverse habitats and other animals in the Middle East may fill the evolutionary gap.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']","Susanna K P Lau, Kenneth S M Li, Alan K L Tsang, Carol S F Lam, Shakeel Ahmed, Honglin Chen, Kwok-Hung Chan, Patrick C Y Woo, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23720729
94,Prevalence and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats from China,"Coronaviruses can infect a variety of animals including poultry, livestock, and humans and are currently classified into three groups. The interspecies transmissions of coronaviruses between different hosts form a complex ecosystem of which little is known. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent identification of new coronaviruses have highlighted the necessity for further investigation of coronavirus ecology, in particular the role of bats and other wild animals. In this study, we sampled bat populations in 15 provinces of China and reveal that approximately 6.5% of the bats, from diverse species distributed throughout the region, harbor coronaviruses. Full genomes of four coronavirues from bats were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, revealed that bat coronaviruses cluster in three different groups: group 1, another group that includes all SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses (putative group 4), and an independent bat coronavirus group (putative group 5). Further genetic analyses showed that different species of bats maintain coronaviruses from different groups and that a single bat species from different geographic locations supports similar coronaviruses. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that bats may play an integral role in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Faculty of Medicine Building, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, China.']","X C Tang, J X Zhang, S Y Zhang, P Wang, X H Fan, L F Li, G Li, B Q Dong, W Liu, C L Cheung, K M Xu, W J Song, D Vijaykrishna, L L M Poon, J S M Peiris, G J D Smith, H Chen, Y Guan, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16840328
95,Fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin,"Cross-species transmission of viruses from wildlife animal reservoirs poses a marked threat to human and animal health 1 . Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2-10 . Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96-98% sequence identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013-2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '2 Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China.', '3 College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', '4 Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangzhou, China.', '5 Key\xa0Laboratory of Etiology and Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Universities of Shandong, Taishan Medical College, Taian, China.', '6 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', '7 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangzhou, China.', '8 School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '9 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Laboratory Animals, Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute, Guangzhou, China.', '10 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY, USA. daszak@ecohealthalliance.org.', '11 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore. linfa.wang@duke-nus.edu.sg.', '12 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.', '13 Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China. tong.yigang@gmail.com.', '14 School of Life Sciences, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, China. tong.yigang@gmail.com.', '15 College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China. majy2400@scau.edu.cn.', '16 Key Laboratory of Animal Health Aquaculture and Environmental Control, Guangzhou, China. majy2400@scau.edu.cn.']","Peng Zhou, Hang Fan, Tian Lan, Xing-Lou Yang, Wei-Feng Shi, Wei Zhang, Yan Zhu, Ya-Wei Zhang, Qing-Mei Xie, Shailendra Mani, Xiao-Shuang Zheng, Bei Li, Jin-Man Li, Hua Guo, Guang-Qian Pei, Xiao-Ping An, Jun-Wei Chen, Ling Zhou, Kai-Jie Mai, Zi-Xian Wu, Di Li, Danielle E Anderson, Li-Biao Zhang, Shi-Yue Li, Zhi-Qiang Mi, Tong-Tong He, Feng Cong, Peng-Ju Guo, Ren Huang, Yun Luo, Xiang-Ling Liu, Jing Chen, Yong Huang, Qiang Sun, Xiang-Li-Lan Zhang, Yuan-Yuan Wang, Shao-Zhen Xing, Yan-Shan Chen, Yuan Sun, Juan Li, Peter Daszak, Lin-Fa Wang, Zheng-Li Shi, Yi-Gang Tong, Jing-Yun Ma, ",Nature,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29618817
96,Bats are a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses,"Although there are over 1,150 bat species worldwide, the diversity of viruses harbored by bats has only recently come into focus as a result of expanded wildlife surveillance. Such surveys are of importance in determining the potential for novel viruses to emerge in humans, and for optimal management of bats and their habitats. To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats, we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1,258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia. A total of 83 bat-derived viruses were identified, representing an infection rate of nearly 5%. Evolutionary analyses revealed that all known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, including those previously documented in humans and other primates, fall within the phylogenetic diversity of the bat-derived viruses described here. The prevalence, unprecedented viral biodiversity, phylogenetic divergence, and worldwide distribution of the bat-derived viruses suggest that bats are a major and ancient natural reservoir for both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses and provide insights into the evolutionary history of hepatitis C virus and the human GB viruses.","['1 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. pq2106@columbia.edu']","Phenix-Lan Quan, Cadhla Firth, Juliette M Conte, Simon H Williams, Carlos M Zambrana-Torrelio, Simon J Anthony, James A Ellison, Amy T Gilbert, Ivan V Kuzmin, Michael Niezgoda, Modupe O V Osinubi, Sergio Recuenco, Wanda Markotter, Robert F Breiman, Lems Kalemba, Jean Malekani, Kim A Lindblade, Melinda K Rostal, Rafael Ojeda-Flores, Gerardo Suzan, Lora B Davis, Dianna M Blau, Albert B Ogunkoya, Danilo A Alvarez Castillo, David Moran, Sali Ngam, Dudu Akaibe, Bernard Agwanda, Thomas Briese, Jonathan H Epstein, Peter Daszak, Charles E Rupprecht, Edward C Holmes, W Ian Lipkin, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2013,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23610427

Pair-wise alignment and comparison of coding regions of the S, M, and L segments of hantaviruses from Taphozous and Hipposideros bats revealed high nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities to prototype Láibīn virus (LAIV) and Xuân Sơn virus (XSV), respectively. Phylogenetic analyses, generated by maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, showed a geographic clustering of LAIV strains from China and Myanmar, but not of XSV strains from China and Vietnam.

98,Virome analysis for identification of novel mammalian viruses in bat species from Chinese provinces,"Bats are natural hosts for a large variety of zoonotic viruses. This study aimed to describe the range of bat viromes, including viruses from mammals, insects, fungi, plants, and phages, in 11 insectivorous bat species (216 bats in total) common in six provinces of China. To analyze viromes, we used sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina). The viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons to known viruses. The mammalian viruses included those of the Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Retroviridae, Circoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Astroviridae, Flaviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Parvovirinae; insect viruses included those of the Baculoviridae, Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tetraviridae, and Densovirinae; fungal viruses included those of the Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Totiviridae; and phages included those of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, and Microviridae and unclassified phages. In addition to the viruses and phages associated with the insects, plants, and bacterial flora related to the diet and habitation of bats, we identified the complete or partial genome sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses. These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these novel viruses showed little genetic similarity with previously reported viruses. This study also revealed a high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces. These findings have expanded our understanding of the viromes of bats in China and hinted at the presence of a large variety of unknown mammalian viruses in many common bat species of mainland China.","[""1 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]","Zhiqiang Wu, Xianwen Ren, Li Yang, Yongfeng Hu, Jian Yang, Guimei He, Junpeng Zhang, Jie Dong, Lilian Sun, Jiang Du, Liguo Liu, Ying Xue, Jianmin Wang, Fan Yang, Shuyi Zhang, Qi Jin, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22855479
99,A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1-4. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.

101,Intraspecies diversity of SARS-like coronaviruses in Rhinolophus sinicus and its implications for the origin of SARS coronaviruses in humans,"The Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) has been suggested to carry the direct ancestor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), and the diversity of SARS-like CoVs (SLCoV) within this Rhinolophus species is therefore worth investigating. Here, we demonstrate the remarkable diversity of SLCoVs in R. sinicus and identify a strain with the same pattern of phylogenetic incongruence (i.e. an indication of recombination) as reported previously in another SLCoV strain. Moreover, this strain possesses a distinctive 579 nt deletion in the nsp3 region that was also found in a human SCoV from the late-phase epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis of the Orf1 region suggested that the human SCoVs are phylogenetically closer to SLCoVs in R. sinicus than to SLCoVs in other Rhinolophus species. These findings reveal a closer evolutionary linkage between SCoV in humans and SLCoVs in R. sinicus, defining the scope of surveillance to search for the direct ancestor of human SCoVs.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Wuhan, PR China.']","Junfa Yuan, Chung-Chau Hon, Yan Li, Dingming Wang, Gelin Xu, Huajun Zhang, Peng Zhou, Leo L M Poon, Tommy Tsan-Yuk Lam, Frederick Chi-Ching Leung, Zhengli Shi, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20016037
102,Delusional parasitosis on the psychiatric consultation service - a longitudinal perspective: case study,"Background:
        
      
      Delusional parasitosis is infrequently seen in hospital-based consultation-liaison psychiatry. Aims:
        
      
      Although there are many publications on delusional parasitosis, this report reviews a unique case that was diagnosed during a hospital admission and treated over the next 36 months. Method:
        
      
      Case report and literature review. Results:
        
      
      This case report describes a 65-year-old man who was diagnosed with delusional parasitosis during a hospital admission for congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury. A longitudinal description of the patient's condition during the hospital stay and in the 36 months following discharge, during which time he was treated by a consultation psychiatrist, is provided. Conclusions:
        
      
      In discussing the treatment of a challenging presentation, this case demonstrates the opportunity for consultation psychiatrists to initiate care in patients who might not otherwise seek psychiatric services. Patients with somatic delusions represent one group of patients who are unlikely to independently seek psychiatric treatment. Declaration of interest:

In this study, we describe the isolation of Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) from rectal swab samples of Pteropus vampyrus in Indonesia. PRV is an emerging zoonotic respiratory virus that can be transmitted from bats to humans. Rectal swabs (n = 91) were screened by PCR for PRV and 10 (11%) were positive. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences indicated that the S2, S3, S4, M3, L2, and L3 segments of one isolate (Garut-69) were closely related to previously isolated strains in Indonesia. The remaining gene segments showed both similarity and genetic divergence with other PRV strains, suggesting that re-assortment events had occurred.

The lyssavirus surveillance system was continuously conducted to understand the epidemiology. Through this system, the found dead bats were collected for lyssavirus detection by direct fluorescent antibody test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Three bats were identified as positive during 2018-2021. A novel lyssavirus, designated as Taiwan bat lyssavirus 2, was detected in a Nyctalus plancyi velutinus. This lyssavirus had less than 80% nucleotide identity in the nucleoprotein (N) gene with other lyssavirus species, forming a separate branch in the phylogenetic analysis. The other two cases were identified in Pipistrellus abramus (Japanese pipistrelles); they were identified to be similar to the former lyssavirus identified in 2016-2017, which was renominated as Taiwan bat lyssavirus 1 (TWBLV-1) in this study. Even though one of the TWBLV-1 isolates showed high genetic diversity in the N gene compared with other TWBLV-1 isolates, it may be a TWBLV-1 variant but not a new species based on its high amino acid identities in the nucleoprotein, same host species, and same geographic location as the other TWBLV-1.","['1 Animal Health Research Institute, New Taipei City 251203, Taiwan.', '2 Bat Conservation Society of Taipei, Taipei City 106056, Taiwan.']","Shu-Chia Hu, Chao-Lung Hsu, Fan Lee, Yang-Chang Tu, Yen-Wen Chen, Jen-Chieh Chang, Wei-Cheng Hsu, ",Viruses,2022,Nyctalus plancyi velutinus; Pipistrellus abramus; Taiwan; bat; lyssavirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35891542
105,Genetic diversity of Nipah virus in Bangladesh,"Background:
        
      
      Nipah virus (NiV) infection, often fatal in humans, is primarily transmitted in Bangladesh through the consumption of date palm sap contaminated by Pteropus bats. Person-to-person transmission is also common and increases the concern of large outbreaks. This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology, phylogenetic relationship, and the evolution of the nucleocapsid gene (N gene) of NiV. Methods:
        
      
      We conducted molecular detection, genetic characterization, and Bayesian time-scale evolution analyses of NiV using pooled Pteropid bat roost urine samples from an outbreak area in 2012 and archived RNA samples from NiV case patients identified during 2012-2018 in Bangladesh. Results:
        
      
      NiV-RNA was detected in 19% (38/456) of bat roost urine samples and among them; nine N gene sequences were recovered. We also retrieved sequences from 53% (21 out of 39) of archived RNA samples from patients. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Bangladeshi strains belonged to NiV-BD genotype and had an evolutionary rate of 4.64 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year. The analyses suggested that the strains of NiV-BD genotype diverged during 1995 and formed two sublineages. Conclusion:
        
      
      This analysis provides further evidence that the NiV strains of the Malaysian and Bangladesh genotypes diverged recently and continue to evolve. More extensive surveillance of NiV in bats and human will be helpful to explore strain diversity and virulence potential to infect humans through direct or person-to-person virus transmission.","['1 Infectious Diseases Division (IDD), icddr,b, 68, Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmed Sarani, Mohakhali, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh.

106,Characterization of Oita virus 296/1972 of Rhabdoviridae isolated from a horseshoe bat bearing characteristics of both lyssavirus and vesiculovirus,"Oita virus 296/1972 was isolated from the blood of a wild horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus cornutus (Temminck) in 1972. We investigated the pathogenicity of this virus in mice in relation to its histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics and the entire sequence of nucleoprotein gene. This virus caused lethal encephalitis in mice through intracerebral route. This susceptibility of mice was until 3 weeks of age. Immunohistochemical analysis using the convalescent sera obtained from survived adult mice after intracerebral inoculation revealed that many neurons were positive in the cytoplasm, besides no cross reactivity with normal and rabies virus-infected mouse brain tissues to this anti-sera. Ultrastructural analysis disclosed many bullet-shaped and enveloped virions in neurons. These morphological characteristics of the virions are consistent of that of viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae. Budding from endoplasmic membrane suggests that this virus has a similarity with lyssaviruses. Molecular analysis of cDNA coding a tentative nucleoprotein sequence revealed homology with those of viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae. Distance matrix analysis of this gene sequence with those of other rhabdoviruses isolated from mammals disclosed the discrete position of this virus in the phylogenic tree of rhabdoviridae infecting mammals and we renamed this virus as Oita rhabdovirus.","['1 Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.']","T Iwasaki, S Inoue, K Tanaka, Y Sato, S Morikawa, D Hayasaka, M Moriyama, T Ono, S Kanai, A Yamada, T Kurata, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15168201

108,Detection of rhabdovirus viral RNA in oropharyngeal swabs and ectoparasites of Spanish bats,"Rhabdoviruses infect a variety of hosts, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects and plants. As bats are the natural host for most members of the genus Lyssavirus, the specificity of the amplification methods used for active surveillance is usually restricted to lyssaviruses. However, the presence of other rhabdoviruses in bats has also been reported. In order to broaden the scope of such methods, a new RT-PCR, able to detect a diverse range of rhabdoviruses, was designed. The method detected 81 of 86 different rhabdoviruses. In total, 1488 oropharyngeal bat swabs and 38 nycteribiid samples were analysed, and 17 unique rhabdovirus-related sequences were detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that those sequences detected in bats did not constitute a monophyletic group, even when originating from the same bat species. However, all of the sequences detected in nycteribiids and one sequence obtained from a bat did constitute a monophyletic group with Drosophila melanogaster sigma rhabdovirus.","['1 Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid 28220, Spain.', '2 Centro de Investigación Biomédica de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, CIBERESP, Spain.', '3 Wildlife Zoonoses and Vector-borne Diseases Research Group (OIE Reference Laboratory/WHO Collaborating Centre), Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA, Weybridge), New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 3NB, UK.', '4 Estación Biológica de Doñana, CSIC, Seville 41092, Andalusia, Spain.', '5 Department of Zoology and Animal Cell Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa 48940, The Basque Country, Spain.', '6 University of Liverpool, National Consortium for Zoonosis Research, Leahurst, Neston, South Wirral CH64 7TE, UK.']","Carolina Aznar-Lopez, Sonia Vazquez-Moron, Denise A Marston, Javier Juste, Carlos Ibáñez, Jose Miguel Berciano, Egoitz Salsamendi, Joxerra Aihartza, Ashley C Banyard, Lorraine McElhinney, Anthony R Fooks, Juan Echevarria, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23100368

110,"Tioman virus, a novel paramyxovirus isolated from fruit bats in Malaysia","A search for the natural host of Nipah virus has led to the isolation of a previously unknown member of the family Paramyxoviridae. Tioman virus (TiV) was isolated from the urine of fruit bats (Pteropus hypomelanus) found on the island of the same name off the eastern coast of peninsular Malaysia. An electron microscopic study of TiV-infected cells revealed spherical and pleomorphic-enveloped viral particles (100--500 nm in size) with a single fringe of embedded peplomers. Virus morphogenesis occurred at the plasma membrane of infected cells and morphological features of negative-stained ribonucleoprotein complexes were compatible with that of viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae. Serological studies revealed no cross-reactivity with antibodies against a number of known Paramyxoviridae members except for the newly described Menangle virus (MenV), isolated in Australia in 1997. Failure of PCR amplification using MenV-specific primers suggested that this new virus is related to but different from MenV. For molecular characterization of the virus, a cDNA subtraction strategy was employed to isolate virus-specific cDNA from virus-infected cells. Complete gene sequences for the nucleocapsid protein (N) and phosphoprotein (P/V) have been determined and recombinant N and V proteins produced in baculovirus. The recombinant N and V proteins reacted with porcine anti-MenV sera in Western blot, confirming the serological cross-reactivity observed during initial virus characterization. The lack of a C protein-coding region in the P/V gene, the creation of P mRNA by insertion of 2-G residues, and the results of phylogenetic analyses all indicated that TiV is a novel member of the genus Rubulavirus.","['1 Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Malaya Medical Center, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']","K B Chua, L F Wang, S K Lam, G Crameri, M Yu, T Wise, D Boyle, A D Hyatt, B T Eaton, ",Virology,2001,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11336547

112,Molecular characterization of Nipah virus from Pteropus hypomelanus in Southern Thailand,"Background:
        
      
      Nipah virus (NiV) first emerged in Malaysia in 1998, with two bat species (Pteropus hypomelanus and P. vampyrus) as the putative natural reservoirs. In 2002, NiV IgG antibodies were detected in these species from Thailand, but viral RNA could not be detected for strain characterization. Two strains of NiV (Malaysia and Bangladesh) have been found in P. lylei in central Thailand, although Bangladesh strain, the causative strain for the outbreak in Bangladesh since 2001, was dominant. To understand the diversity of NiV in Thailand, this study identified NiV strain, using molecular characterizations, from P. hypomelanus in southern Thailand. Findings:
        
      
      Pooled bat urine specimens were collected from plastic sheet underneath bat roosts in April 2010, and then monthly from December 2010 to May 2011 at an island in southern Thailand. Five in 184 specimens were positive for NiV, using duplex nested RT-PCR assay on partial nucleocapsid fragment (357 bp). Whole sequences of nucleocapsid gene from four bats were characterized. All 5 partial fragments and 4 whole nucleocapsid genes formed a monophyletic with NiV-MY. Conclusions:
        
      
      Our study showed that P. hypomelanus in southern Thailand and from Malaysia, a bordering country, harbored similar NiV. This finding indicates that NiV is not limited to central Thailand or P. lylei species, and it may be a source of inter-species transmission. This indicates a higher potential for a widespread NiV outbreak in Thailand. NiV surveillance in Pteropus bats, the major natural reservoirs, should be conducted continuously in countries or regions with high susceptibility to outbreaks.","['1 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. spwa@hotmail.com.', '2 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand.', '3 World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Panumas Samseeneam, Mana Phermpool, Thongchai Kaewpom, Apaporn Rodpan, Pattarapol Maneeorn, Phimchanok Srongmongkol, Budsabong Kanchanasaka, Thiravat Hemachudha, ",Virology journal,2016,Bats; Nipah virus; Southern; Strain; Thailand; Transmission.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27016237
113,Molecular Identification of a Novel Hantavirus in Malaysian Bronze Tube-Nosed Bats ( Murina aenea),"In the past ten years, several novel hantaviruses were discovered in shrews, moles, and bats, suggesting the dispersal of hantaviruses in many animal taxa other than rodents during their evolution. Interestingly, the coevolutionary analyses of most recent studies have raised the possibility that nonrodents may have served as the primordial mammalian host and harboured the ancestors of rodent-borne hantaviruses as well. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of hantaviruses in bat lung tissue homogenates originally collected for taxonomic purposes in Malaysia in 2015. Hantavirus-specific nested RT-PCR screening of 116 samples targeting the L segment of the virus has revealed the positivity of two lung tissue homogenates originating from two individuals, a female and a male of the Murina aenea bat species collected at the same site and sampling occasion. Nanopore sequencing of hantavirus positive samples resulted in partial genomic data from S, M, and L genome segments. The obtained results indicate molecular evidence for hantaviruses in the M. aenea bat species. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplicon and partial genome segments suggests that the identified virus may represent a novel species in the Mobatvirus genus within the Hantaviridae family.

116,Pulau virus; a new member of the Nelson Bay orthoreovirus species isolated from fruit bats in Malaysia,"After the outbreak of Nipah virus (NiV) in 1998-99, which resulted in 105 human deaths and the culling of more than one million pigs, a search was initiated for the natural host reservoir of NiV on Tioman Island off the east coast of Malaysia. Three different syncytia-forming viruses were isolated from fruit bats on the island. They were Nipah virus, Tioman virus (a novel paramyxovirus related to Menangle virus), and a reovirus, named Pulau virus (PuV), which is the subject of this study. PuV displayed the typical ultra structural morphology of a reovirus and was neutralised by serum against Nelson Bay reovirus (NBV), a reovirus isolated from a fruit bat (Pteropus poliocephalus) in Australia over 30 years ago. PuV was fusogenic and formed large syncytia in Vero cells. Comparison of dsRNA segments between PuV and NBV showed distinct mobility differences for the S1 and S2 segments. Complete sequence analysis of all four S segments revealed a close relationship between PuV and NBV, with nucleotide sequence identity varying from 88% for S3 segment to 56% for the S1 segment. Similarly phylogenetic analysis of deduced protein sequences confirmed that PuV is closely related to NBV. In this paper we discuss the similarities and differences between PuV and NBV which support the classification of PuV as a novel mammalian, fusogenic reovirus within the Nelson Bay orthoreovirus species, in the genus Orthoreovirus, family Reoviridae.","['1 CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia.

117,First isolation and characterization of pteropine orthoreoviruses in fruit bats in the Philippines,"Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) causes respiratory tract illness (RTI) in humans. PRVs were isolated from throat swabs collected from 9 of 91 wild bats captured on the Mindanao Islands, The Philippines, in 2013. The nucleic acid sequence of the whole genome of each of these isolates was determined. Phylogenetic analysis based on predicted amino acid sequences indicated that the isolated PRVs were novel strains in which re-assortment events had occurred in the viral genome. Serum specimens collected from 76 of 84 bats were positive for PRV-neutralizing antibodies suggesting a high prevalence of PRV in wild bats in the Philippines. The bat-borne PRVs isolated in the Philippines were characterized in comparison to an Indonesian PRV isolate, Miyazaki-Bali/2007 strain, recovered from a human patient, revealing that the Philippine bat-borne PRVs had similar characteristics in terms of antigenicity to those of the Miyazaki-Bali/2007 strain, but with a slight difference (e.g., growth capacity in vitro). The impact of the Philippine bat-borne PRVs should be studied in human RTI cases in the Philippines.","['1 Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan.', '2 Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Joint Faculty of Veterinary MedicineYamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi, 753-8515, Japan.', '3 Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life SciencesThe University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.', '4 College of Veterinary Medicine, University of the Philippine Los Baños, Los Baños, 4031, Laguna, Philippines.', '5 University of the Philippines Mindanao, Bago-Oshiro, Davao, Philippines.', '6 Museum of Natural History, University of the Philippines Los Baños, Los Baños, 4031, Laguna, Philippines.', '7 Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan.', '8 Research and Education Center for Prevention of Global Infectious Diseases of Animals, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu-shi, Tokyo, 183-8509, Japan.', '9 Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, 252-5201, Japan.', '10 Department of Animal Risk Management, Chiba Institute of Science, Choshi, Chiba, 288-0025, Japan.', '11 Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo, 208-0011, Japan. msaijo@niid.go.jp.', '12 Department of Virology 1, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 1-23-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8640, Japan. msaijo@niid.go.jp.', '13 Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life SciencesThe University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.']","Satoshi Taniguchi, Ken Maeda, Taisuke Horimoto, Joseph S Masangkay, Roberto Puentespina Jr, James Alvarez, Eduardo Eres, Edison Cosico, Noriyo Nagata, Kazutaka Egawa, Harpal Singh, Aiko Fukuma, Tomoki Yoshikawa, Hideki Tani, Shuetsu Fukushi, Shinobu Tsuchiaka, Tsutomu Omatsu, Tetsuya Mizutani, Yumi Une, Yasuhiro Yoshikawa, Masayuki Shimojima, Masayuki Saijo, Shigeru Kyuwa, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28190201
118,Identification of a novel lineage bat SARS-related coronaviruses that use bat ACE2 receptor,"Severe respiratory disease coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most devastating disease COVID-19 in the century. One of the unsolved scientific questions of SARS-CoV-2 is the animal origin of this virus. Bats and pangolins are recognized as the most probable reservoir hosts that harbour highly similar SARS-CoV-2 related viruses (SARSr-CoV-2). This study identified a novel lineage of SARSr-CoVs, including RaTG15 and seven other viruses, from bats at the same location where we found RaTG13 in 2015. Although RaTG15 and the related viruses share 97.2% amino acid sequence identities with SARS-CoV-2 in the conserved ORF1b region, it only shows less than 77.6% nucleotide identity to all known SARSr-CoVs at the genome level, thus forming a distinct lineage in the Sarbecovirus phylogenetic tree. We found that the RaTG15 receptor-binding domain (RBD) can bind to ACE2 from Rhinolophus affinis, Malayan pangolin, and use it as an entry receptor, except for ACE2 from humans. However, it contains a short deletion and has different key residues responsible for ACE2 binding. In addition, we showed that none of the known viruses in bat SARSr-CoV-2 lineage discovered uses human ACE2 as efficiently as the pangolin-derived SARSr-CoV-2 or some viruses in the SARSr-CoV-1 lineage. Therefore, further systematic and longitudinal studies in bats are needed to prevent future spillover events caused by SARSr-CoVs or to understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2 better.","[""1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]","Hua Guo, Ben Hu, Hao-Rui Si, Yan Zhu, Wei Zhang, Bei Li, Ang Li, Rong Geng, Hao-Feng Lin, Xing-Lou Yang, Peng Zhou, Zheng-Li Shi, ",Emerging microbes & infections,NO_DATE,ACE2; SARS-related coronavirus; bat; novel lineage; reservoir host.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34263709
119,Characterisation of an Indonesian very virulent strain of infectious bursal disease virus,"An Indonesian very virulent (vv) strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), designated Tasik94, was characterised both in vivo and at the molecular level. Inoculation of Tasik94 into 5-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens resulted in 100% morbidity and 45% mortality. The complete nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of genomic segments A and B were determined. Across each of the three deduced open reading frames (ORFs), Tasik94 shared the greatest nucleotide homology to Dutch vv strain D6948. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using 15 full-length polyprotein sequences and a total of 105 VP2 hypervariable region sequences from geographically and pathogenically diverse strains. In each case, Tasik94 grouped closely with vv strains, particularly those from Europe. The deduced VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 protein sequences of Tasik94 were aligned with those from published strains and putative virulence determinants were identified in VP2, VP3 and VP4. Alignment of additional protein sequences across the VP2 hypervariable region confirmed that residues Ile[242], Ile[256] and Ile[294] were highly-conserved amongst vv strains, and may account for their enhanced virulence.","['1 CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia. matthew.rudd@csiro.au']","M F Rudd, H G Heine, S I Sapats, L Parede, J Ignjatovic, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12111410
120,Novel Bat Alphacoronaviruses in Southern China Support Chinese Horseshoe Bats as an Important Reservoir for Potential Novel Coronaviruses,"While bats are increasingly recognized as a source of coronavirus epidemics, the diversity and emergence potential of bat coronaviruses remains to be fully understood. Among 1779 bat samples collected in China, diverse coronaviruses were detected in 32 samples from five different bat species by RT-PCR. Two novel alphacoronaviruses, Rhinolophus sinicus bat coronavirus HKU32 (Rs-BatCoV HKU32) and Tylonycteris robustula bat coronavirus HKU33 (Tr-BatCoV HKU33), were discovered from Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong and greater bamboo bats in Guizhou Province, respectively. Genome analyses showed that Rs-BatCoV HKU32 is closely related to BatCoV HKU10 and related viruses from diverse bat families, whereas Tr-BatCoV HKU33 is closely related to BtNv-AlphaCoV and similar viruses exclusively from bats of Vespertilionidae family. The close relatedness of Rs-BatCoV HKU32 to BatCoV HKU10 which was also detected in Pomona roundleaf bats from the same country park suggests that these viruses may have the tendency of infecting genetically distant bat populations of close geographical proximity with subsequent genetic divergence. Moreover, the presence of SARSr-CoV ORF7a-like protein in Rs-BatCoV HKU32 suggests a common evolutionary origin of this accessory protein with SARS-CoV, also from Chinese horseshoe bats, an apparent reservoir for coronavirus epidemics. The emergence potential of Rs-BatCoV HKU32 should be explored.","['1 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. skplau@hku.hk.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. skplau@hku.hk.', '3 Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. skplau@hku.hk.', '4 Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. skplau@hku.hk.', '5 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. antonwcp@connect.hku.hk.', '6 Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangzhou 510000, China. zhanglb@giabr.gd.cn.', '7 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. hkhluk@hku.hk.', '8 School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China. jamie_slk@link.cuhk.edu.hk.', '9 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. shakeel87@gmail.com.', '10 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. caijuice@hku.hk.', '11 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. pyrear@126.com.', '12 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. llteng@hku.hk.', '13 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. llteng@hku.hk.', '14 Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. llteng@hku.hk.', '15 School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China. kwtsui@cuhk.edu.hk.', '16 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. kyyuen@hku.hk.', '17 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. kyyuen@hku.hk.', '18 Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. kyyuen@hku.hk.', '19 Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. kyyuen@hku.hk.', '20 Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. pcywoo@hku.hk.', '21 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. pcywoo@hku.hk.', '22 Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. pcywoo@hku.hk.', '23 Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. pcywoo@hku.hk.']","Susanna K P Lau, Antonio C P Wong, Libao Zhang, Hayes K H Luk, Jamie S L Kwok, Syed S Ahmed, Jian-Piao Cai, Pyrear S H Zhao, Jade L L Teng, Stephen K W Tsui, Kwok-Yung Yuen, Patrick C Y Woo, ",Viruses,2019,Alphacoronavirus; bat; coronavirus; discovery; epidemics; molecular; novel; species.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31067830

125,Infectious KoRV-related retroviruses circulating in Australian bats,"Bats are reservoirs of emerging viruses that are highly pathogenic to other mammals, including humans. Despite the diversity and abundance of bat viruses, to date they have not been shown to harbor exogenous retroviruses. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a group of koala retrovirus-related (KoRV-related) gammaretroviruses in Australian and Asian bats. These include the Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus (HPG), identified in the scat of the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), which is the first reproduction-competent retrovirus found in bats. HPG is a close relative of KoRV and the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), with virion morphology and Mn2+-dependent virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity typical of a gammaretrovirus. In vitro, HPG is capable of infecting bat and human cells, but not mouse cells, and displays a similar pattern of cell tropism as KoRV-A and GALV. Population studies reveal the presence of HPG and KoRV-related sequences in several locations across northeast Australia, as well as serologic evidence for HPG in multiple pteropid bat species, while phylogenetic analysis places these bat viruses as the basal group within the KoRV-related retroviruses.

127,Characterization of a novel G3P[3] rotavirus isolated from a lesser horseshoe bat: a distant relative of feline/canine rotaviruses,"Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many viruses pathogenic to humans. An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 × 10² 50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.","['1 Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, China.']","Biao He, Fanli Yang, Weihong Yang, Yuzhen Zhang, Yun Feng, Jihua Zhou, Jinxin Xie, Ye Feng, Xiaolei Bao, Huancheng Guo, Yingying Li, Lele Xia, Nan Li, Jelle Matthijnssens, Hailin Zhang, Changchun Tu, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24027312
128,Complete genome sequence of bat coronavirus HKU2 from Chinese horseshoe bats revealed a much smaller spike gene with a different evolutionary lineage from the rest of the genome,"Apart from bat-SARS-CoV, we have identified a novel group 1 coronavirus, bat-CoV HKU2, in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats). Since it has been suggested that the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV may have been acquired from a group 1 coronavirus, we conducted a surveillance study and identified bat-SARS-CoV and bat-CoV HKU2 in 8.7% and 7.5% respectively of R. sinicus in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Complete genome sequencing of four strains of bat-CoV HKU2 revealed the smallest coronavirus genome (27164 nucleotides) and a unique spike protein evolutionarily distinct from the rest of the genome. This spike protein, sharing similar deletions with other group 2 coronaviruses in its C-terminus, also contained a 15-amino acid peptide homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM of spike protein of SARS-CoV, which was absent in other coronaviruses except bat-SARS-CoV. These suggest a common evolutionary origin in the spike protein of bat-CoV HKU2, bat-SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Hong Kong.']","Susanna K P Lau, Patrick C Y Woo, Kenneth S M Li, Yi Huang, Ming Wang, Carol S F Lam, Huifang Xu, Rongtong Guo, Kwok-Hung Chan, Bo-Jian Zheng, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Virology,2007,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17617433
129,Detection of Recombinant Rousettus Bat Coronavirus GCCDC1 in Lesser Dawn Bats ( Eonycteris spelaea) in Singapore,"Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (RoBat-CoV GCCDC1) is a cross-family recombinant coronavirus that has previously only been reported in wild-caught bats in Yúnnan, China. We report the persistence of a related strain in a captive colony of lesser dawn bats captured in Singapore. Genomic evidence of the virus was detected using targeted enrichment sequencing, and further investigated using deeper, unbiased high throughput sequencing. RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 Singapore shared 96.52% similarity with RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 356 (NC_030886) at the nucleotide level, and had a high prevalence in the captive bat colony. It was detected at five out of six sampling time points across the course of 18 months. A partial segment 1 from an ancestral Pteropine orthoreovirus, p10, makes up the recombinant portion of the virus, which shares high similarity with previously reported RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 strains that were detected in Yúnnan, China. RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 is an intriguing, cross-family recombinant virus, with a geographical range that expands farther than was previously known. The discovery of RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 in Singapore indicates that this recombinant coronavirus exists in a broad geographical range, and can persist in bat colonies long-term.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.', '2 Genomics and Bioinformatics Department, Biological Defense Research Directorate, Naval Medical Research Center-Frederick, Fort Detrick, MD 21702, USA.', '3 Leidos, Reston, VA 20190, USA.', '4 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857, Singapore.', '5 Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060, USA.']","Adrian C Paskey, Justin H J Ng, Gregory K Rice, Wan Ni Chia, Casandra W Philipson, Randy J H Foo, Regina Z Cer, Kyle A Long, Matthew R Lueder, Xiao Fang Lim, Kenneth G Frey, Theron Hamilton, Danielle E Anderson, Eric D Laing, Ian H Mendenhall, Gavin J Smith, Lin-Fa Wang, Kimberly A Bishop-Lilly, ",Viruses,2020,Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1; coronavirus; lesser dawn bat; recombinant.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422932

Incorporation of IC RNA distinguished false and true negative results. The extrinsic RNA was added directly to the PCR master mix and co-amplified with virus specific RNA in a duplex reaction to determine the presence of PCR inhibitor. Limit of detection was affected minimally when IC was added. Of 53 pooled urine samples collected from fruit bats (Pteropus lylei), 16 were validated by the presence of IC band on gel electrophoresis. Seven of these were also Nipah virus RNA positive. The remaining 37 samples were considered invalid. Twenty-two urine samples became valid after dilution of 1:5 and re-examined; two were Nipah virus RNA positive. These nine positive results were confirmed by sequencing of heminested PCR products. The result indicated that at least two different Nipah strains circulated in this bat species from Thailand. This method should be useful for surveillance for Nipah virus infection in animals in a country where a biosecurity level (BSL) 4 laboratory is not available. PCR inhibitors were present in a significant number of bat urine samples. The technique described in this study should improve reliability of surveillance statistics.","['1 Molecular Biology Laboratory for Neurological Diseases, Department of Medicine Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Rama 4 Road, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. spwa02@yahoo.com']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Thiravat Hemachudha, ",Journal of virological methods,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17184850

132,A longitudinal study of the prevalence of Nipah virus in Pteropus lylei bats in Thailand: evidence for seasonal preference in disease transmission,"After 12 serial Nipah virus outbreaks in humans since 1998, it has been noted that all except the initial event in Malaysia occurred during the first 5 months of the year. Increasingly higher morbidity and mortality have been observed in subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh. This may have been related to different virus strains and transmission capability from bat to human without the need for an amplifying host and direct human-to-human transmission. A survey of virus strains in Pteropus lylei and seasonal preference for spillover of these viruses was completed in seven provinces of Central Thailand between May 2005 and June 2007. Nipah virus RNA sequences, which belonged to those of the Malaysian and Bangladesh strains, were detected in the urine of these bats, with the Bangladesh strain being dominant. Highest recovery of Nipah virus RNA was observed in May. Of two provincial sites where monthly surveys were done, the Bangladesh strain was almost exclusively detected during April to June. The Malaysian strain was found dispersed during December to June. Although direct contact during breeding (in December to April) was believed to be an important transmission factor, our results may not entirely support the role of breeding activities in spillage of virus. Greater virus shedding over extended periods in the case of the Malaysian strain and the highest peak of virus detection in May in the case of the Bangladesh strain when offspring started to separate may suggest that there may be responsible mechanisms other than direct contact during breeding in the same roost. Knowledge of seasonal preferences of Nipah virus shedding in P. lylei will help us to better understand the dynamics of Nipah virus transmission and have implications for disease management.","['1 Molecular Biology Laboratory for Neurological Diseases, Department of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Kalyanee Boongird, Sawai Wanghongsa, Nitipon Ratanasetyuth, Pornpun Supavonwong, Detchat Saengsen, G N Gongal, Thiravat Hemachudha, ","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19402762
133,Identification of diverse groups of endogenous gammaretroviruses in mega- and microbats,"A previous phylogenetic study suggested that mammalian gammaretroviruses may have originated in bats. Here we report the discovery of RNA transcripts from two putative endogenous gammaretroviruses in frugivorous (Rousettus leschenaultii retrovirus, RlRV) and insectivorous (Megaderma lyra retrovirus, MlRV) bat species. Both genomes possess a large deletion in pol, indicating that they are defective retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places RlRV and MlRV within the diversity of mammalian gammaretroviruses, with the former falling closer to porcine endogenous retroviruses and the latter to Mus dunni endogenous virus, koala retrovirus and gibbon ape leukemia virus. Additional genomic mining suggests that both microbat (Myotis lucifugus) and megabat (Pteropus vampyrus) genomes harbour many copies of endogenous retroviral forms related to RlRV and MlRV. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of three genetically diverse groups of endogenous gammaretroviruses in bat genomes, with M. lucifugus possessing members of all three groups. Taken together, this study indicates that bats harbour distinct gammaretroviruses and may have played an important role as reservoir hosts during the diversification of mammalian gammaretroviruses.","['1 Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', '2 Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, 3004, Australia.', '3 Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia.', '4 Retroviral Biology and Antivirals Laboratory, Centre for Virology, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', '5 CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria 3220, Australia.', '6 Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', '7 Institute of Molecular Ecology and Evolution, Institutes for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, PR China.', '8 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.']","Jie Cui, Gilda Tachedjian, Mary Tachedjian, Edward C Holmes, Shuyi Zhang, Lin-Fa Wang, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22694899

135,Detection and genome characterization of four novel bat hepadnaviruses and a hepevirus in China,"Background:
        
      
      In recent years, novel hepadnaviruses, hepeviruses, hepatoviruses, and hepaciviruses have been discovered in various species of bat around the world, indicating that bats may act as natural reservoirs for these hepatitis viruses. In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China. Methods:
        
      
      A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. Results:
        
      
      Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. Conclusions:
        
      
      This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety and Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', '2 Department of Infectious Diseases, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', '3 Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resource, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', '4 Laboratory for Zoonosis Control and Prevention, Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention, Dali, 671000, China.', '5 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety and Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China. zlshi@wh.iov.cn.']","Bo Wang, Xing-Lou Yang, Wen Li, Yan Zhu, Xing-Yi Ge, Li-Biao Zhang, Yun-Zhi Zhang, Claus-Thomas Bock, Zheng-Li Shi, ",Virology journal,2017,Bat; Genome characterization; Hepadnavirus; Hepevirus; Natural reservoir.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28222808
136,"Recent transmission of a novel alphacoronavirus, bat coronavirus HKU10, from Leschenault's rousettes to pomona leaf-nosed bats: first evidence of interspecies transmission of coronavirus between bats of different suborders","Although coronaviruses are known to infect various animals by adapting to new hosts, interspecies transmission events are still poorly understood. During a surveillance study from 2005 to 2010, a novel alphacoronavirus, BatCoV HKU10, was detected in two very different bat species, Ro-BatCoV HKU10 in Leschenault's rousettes (Rousettus leschenaulti) (fruit bats in the suborder Megachiroptera) in Guangdong and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 in Pomona leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros pomona) (insectivorous bats in the suborder Microchiroptera) in Hong Kong. Although infected bats appeared to be healthy, Pomona leaf-nosed bats carrying Hi-BatCoV HKU10 had lower body weights than uninfected bats. To investigate possible interspecies transmission between the two bat species, the complete genomes of two Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and six Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains were sequenced. Genome and phylogenetic analyses showed that Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 represented a novel alphacoronavirus species, sharing highly similar genomes except in the genes encoding spike proteins, which had only 60.5% amino acid identities. Evolution of the spike protein was also rapid in Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2005 to 2006 but stabilized thereafter. Molecular-clock analysis dated the most recent common ancestor of all BatCoV HKU10 strains to 1959 (highest posterior density regions at 95% [HPDs], 1886 to 2002) and that of Hi-BatCoV HKU10 to 1986 (HPDs, 1956 to 2004). The data suggested recent interspecies transmission from Leschenault's rousettes to Pomona leaf-nosed bats in southern China. Notably, the rapid adaptive genetic change in BatCoV HKU10 spike protein by ~40% amino acid divergence after recent interspecies transmission was even greater than the ~20% amino acid divergence between spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) in bats and civets. This study provided the first evidence for interspecies transmission of coronavirus between bats of different suborders.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']","Susanna K P Lau, Kenneth S M Li, Alan K L Tsang, Chung-Tong Shek, Ming Wang, Garnet K Y Choi, Rongtong Guo, Beatrice H L Wong, Rosana W S Poon, Carol S F Lam, Sylvia Y H Wang, Rachel Y Y Fan, Kwok-Hung Chan, Bo-Jian Zheng, Patrick C Y Woo, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22933277

139,Classification of new morbillivirus and jeilongvirus sequences from bats sampled in Brazil and Malaysia,"As part of a broad One Health surveillance effort to detect novel viruses in wildlife and people, we report several paramyxovirus sequences sampled primarily from bats during 2013 and 2014 in Brazil and Malaysia, including seven from which we recovered full-length genomes. Of these, six represent the first full-length paramyxovirid genomes sequenced from the Americas, including two that are the first full-length bat morbillivirus genome sequences published to date. Our findings add to the vast number of viral sequences in public repositories, which have been increasing considerably in recent years due to the rising accessibility of metagenomics. Taxonomic classification of these sequences in the absence of phenotypic data has been a significant challenge, particularly in the subfamily Orthoparamyxovirinae, where the rate of discovery of novel sequences has been substantial. Using pairwise amino acid sequence classification (PAASC), we propose that five of these sequences belong to members of the genus Jeilongvirus and two belong to members of the genus Morbillivirus. We also highlight inconsistencies in the classification of Tupaia virus and Mòjiāng virus using the same demarcation criteria and suggest reclassification of these viruses into new genera. Importantly, this study underscores the critical importance of sequence length in PAASC analysis as well as the importance of biological characteristics such as genome organization in the taxonomic classification of viral sequences.","['1 Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. hlw2124@columbia.edu.', '2 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY, USA.', '3 Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Transylvania University, Lexington, KY, USA.', '4 Instituto Leônidas and Maria Deane, Fiocruz Amazônia, Manaus, Brazil.', '5 Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine and Animal Health, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', '6 Conservation Medicine, Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia.', '7 Sabah Wildlife Department, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.', '8 Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA.', '9 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', '10 Department of Environmental Science and Policy, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA.', '11 School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.', '12 MRC Unit The Gambia at London, School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Atlantic Boulevard, Fajara, The Gambia.', '13 Zoological Pathology Program, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Brookfield, IL, USA.', '14 One Health Institute and Karen C.

By using a combination of quantitative definitions (bootstrap support level and the pairwise nucleotide sequence identity), the viruses could be classified into clusters, clades, and species. Our phylogenetic study revealed for the first time that from the putative ancestor two branches, non-vector and vector-borne virus clusters, evolved and from the latter cluster emerged tick-borne and mosquito-borne virus clusters. Provided that the theory of arthropod association being an acquired trait was correct, pairwise nucleotide sequence identity among these three clusters provided supporting data for a possibility that the non-vector cluster evolved first, followed by the separation of tick-borne and mosquito-borne virus clusters in that order. Clades established in our study correlated significantly with existing antigenic complexes. We also resolved many of the past taxonomic problems by establishing phylogenetic relationships of the antigenically unclassified viruses with the well-established viruses and by identifying synonymous viruses.","['1 Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado 80522-2087, USA.

142,Bats host diverse parvoviruses as possible origin of mammalian dependoparvoviruses and source for bat-swine interspecies transmission,"Compared to the enormous species diversity of bats, relatively few parvoviruses have been reported. We detected diverse and potentially novel parvoviruses from bats in Hong Kong and mainland China. Parvoviruses belonging to Amdoparvovirus, Bocaparvovirus and Dependoparvovirus were detected in alimentary, liver and spleen samples from 16 different chiropteran species of five families by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of partial helicase sequences showed that they potentially belonged to 25 bocaparvovirus, three dependoparvovirus and one amdoparvovirus species. Nearly complete genome sequencing confirmed the existence of at least four novel bat bocaparvovirus species (Rp-BtBoV1 and Rp-BtBoV2 from Rhinolophus pusillus, Rs-BtBoV2 from Rhinolophus sinicus and Rol-BtBoV1 from Rousettus leschenaultii) and two novel bat dependoparvovirus species (Rp-BtAAV1 from Rhinolophus pusillus and Rs-BtAAV1 from Rhinolophus sinicus). Rs-BtBoV2 was closely related to Ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 with 93, 72.1 and 78.7 % amino acid identities in the NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2 genes, respectively. The detection of bat bocaparvoviruses, including Rs-BtBoV2, closely related to porcine bocaparvoviruses, suggests recent interspecies transmission of bocaparvoviruses between bats and swine. Moreover, Rp-BtAAV1 and Rs-BtAAV1 were most closely related to human AAV1 with 48.7 and 57.5 % amino acid identities in the rep gene. The phylogenetic relationship between BtAAVs and other mammalian AAVs suggests bats as the ancestral origin of mammalian AAVs. Furthermore, parvoviruses of the same species were detected from multiple bat species or families, supporting the ability of bat parvoviruses to cross species barriers.

To analyze pathogenic species in bats from southeast coastal regions of China, we performed metagenomic sequencing technology for high throughput sequencing of six sentinels from southeast coastal area of China. We obtained 5,990,261 high quality reads from intestine and lung tissue of 235 bats, including 2,975,371 assembled sequences. 631,490 reads predicted overlapping sequences for the open reading frame (ORF), which accounts for 2.37% of all the sequences (15,012/631,490). Further, the acquired virus sequences were classified into 25 viral families, including 16 vertebrate viruses, four plant viruses and five insect viruses. All bat samples were screened by specific PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Using these techniques, we discovered many novel bat viruses and some bat viruses closely-related to known human/animal pathogens, including coronavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, astrovirus, and circovirus. In summary, this study extended our understanding of bats as the viral reservoirs. Additionally, it also provides a basis for furher studying the transmission of viruses from bats to humans.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, College of Preventive Medicine, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Research Institute for Medicine of Nanjing Command, Nanjing, 210002, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China.', '4 Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China.', '5 College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang, China.', '6 Department of Epidemiology, Research Institute for Medicine of Nanjing Command, Nanjing, 210002, China. njcdc@163.com.', '7 Department of Epidemiology, College of Preventive Medicine, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China. science2008@hotmail.com.', '8 Department of Epidemiology, Research Institute for Medicine of Nanjing Command, Nanjing, 210002, China. science2008@hotmail.com.']","Dan Hu, Changqiang Zhu, Yi Wang, Lele Ai, Lu Yang, Fuqiang Ye, Chenxi Ding, Jiafeng Chen, Biao He, Jin Zhu, Hui Qian, Wenrong Xu, Youjun Feng, Weilong Tan, Changjun Wang, ",Scientific reports,2017,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28883450
144,Identification and interspecies transmission of a novel bocaparvovirus among different bat species in China,"We report the discovery of a novel bocaparvovirus, bat bocaparvovirus (BtBoV), in one spleen, four respiratory and 61 alimentary samples from bats of six different species belonging to three families, Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. BtBoV showed a higher detection rate in alimentary samples of Rhinolophus sinicus (5.7 %) than those of other bat species (0.43-1.59 %), supporting R. sinicus as the primary reservoir and virus spillover to accidental bat species. BtBoV peaked during the lactating season of R. sinicus, and it was more frequently detected among female than male adult bats (P<0.05), and among lactating than non-lactating female bats (P<0.0001). Positive BtBoV detection was associated with lower body weight in lactating bats (P<0.05). Ten nearly complete BtBoV genomes from three bat species revealed a unique large ORF1 spanning NS1 and NP1 in eight genomes and conserved splicing signals leading to multiple proteins, as well as a unique substitution in the conserved replication initiator motif within NS1. BtBoV was phylogenetically distantly related to known bocaparvoviruses with ≤57.3 % genome identities, supporting BtBoV as a novel species. Ms-BtBoV from Miniopterus schreibersii and Hp-BtBoV from Hipposideros pomona demonstrated 97.2-99.9 % genome identities with Rs-BtBoVs from R. sinicus, supporting infection of different bat species by a single BtBoV species. Rs-BtBoV_str15 represents the first bat parvovirus genome with non-coding regions sequenced, which suggested the presence of head-to-tail genomic concatamers or episomal forms of the genome. This study represents the first to describe interspecies transmission in BoVs. The high detection rates in lactating female and juvenile bats suggest possible vertical transmission of BtBoV.","['1 Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', '2 Carol Yu Centre for Infection, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', '3 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', '4 Research Centre of Infection and Immunology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.', '5 Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, PR China.']","Susanna K P Lau, Syed Shakeel Ahmed, Hazel C Yeung, Kenneth S M Li, Rachel Y Y Fan, Toni Y C Cheng, Jian-Piao Cai, Ming Wang, Bo-Jian Zheng, Samson S Y Wong, Patrick C Y Woo, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27902362
145,Discovery and genetic analysis of novel coronaviruses in least horseshoe bats in southwestern China,"To investigate bat coronaviruses (CoVs), we collected 132 rectal swabs and urine samples from five bat species in three countries in southwestern China. Seven CoVs belonging to distinct groups of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoVs and α-CoVs were detected in samples from least horseshoe bats. Samples from other bat species were negative for these viruses, indicating that the least horseshoe bat represents one of the natural reservoirs and mixers for strains of CoVs and has a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of these viruses. The genetic and evolutionary characteristics of these strains were described. Whole-genome sequencing of a new isolate (F46) from a rectal swab from a least horseshoe bat showed that it contained 29 699 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) tail, with 13 open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic and recombination analyses of F46 provided evidence of natural recombination between bat SARS-like CoVs (Rs3367 and LYRa11) or SARS-CoV (BJ01), suggesting that F46 could be a new recombinant virus from SARS-like CoVs or SARS-CoVs.","[""1 State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory for Zoonosis Control and Prevention of Dali, Dali 671000, Yunnan, People's Republic of China.""]","Lihua Wang, Shihong Fu, Yuxi Cao, Hailin Zhang, Yun Feng, Weihong Yang, Kai Nie, Xuejun Ma, Guodong Liang, ",Emerging microbes & infections,2017,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28352124
146,Identification of diverse alphacoronaviruses and genomic characterization of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus from bats in China,"Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoVs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. Importance:
        
      
      Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan Province.","['1 Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, Jilin Province, China Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', '2 Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention, Dali, Yunnan Province, China.', '3 Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, Jilin Province, China.', '4 Baoshan Prefecture Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Baoshan, Yunnan Province, China.', '5 Yunnan Institute of Endemic Diseases Control and Prevention, Dali, Yunnan Province, China changchun_tu@hotmail.com zhanghl715@163.com.', '6 Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, Jilin Province, China Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China changchun_tu@hotmail.com zhanghl715@163.com.']","Biao He, Yuzhen Zhang, Lin Xu, Weihong Yang, Fanli Yang, Yun Feng, Lele Xia, Jihua Zhou, Weibin Zhen, Ye Feng, Huancheng Guo, Hailin Zhang, Changchun Tu, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24719429

We analyze these data, in conjunction with a comprehensive collection of flavivirus genomes, to characterize flavivirus evolutionary and biogeographic history in unprecedented detail and breadth. Based on the presumed introduction of yellow fever virus into the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade, we extrapolated a timescale for a relevant subset of flaviviruses whose evolutionary history, shows that different Culex-spp. associated flaviviruses have been introduced from the Old World to the New World on at least five separate occasions, with 2 different sets of factors likely to have contributed to the dispersal of the different viruses.

148,Detection of potentially novel paramyxovirus and coronavirus viral RNA in bats and rats in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam,"Bats and rodents are being increasingly recognized as reservoirs of emerging zoonotic viruses. Various studies have investigated bat viruses in tropical regions, but to date there are no data regarding viruses with zoonotic potential that circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. To address this paucity of data, we sampled three bat farms and three wet markets trading in rat meat in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam. Faecal and urine samples were screened for the presence of RNA from paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 4 of 248 (1%) and 11 of 222 (4.9%) bat faecal and urine samples, respectively. Coronavirus RNA was detected in 55 of 248 (22%) of bat faecal samples; filovirus RNA was not detected in any of the bat samples. Further, coronavirus RNA was detected in 12 of 270 (4.4%) of rat faecal samples; all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat paramyxoviruses and bat and rat coronaviruses were related to viruses circulating in bat and rodent populations globally, but showed no cross-species mixing of viruses between bat and rat populations within Viet Nam. Our study shows that potentially novel variants of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses commonly circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. Further characterization of the viruses and additional human and animal surveillance is required to evaluate the likelihood of viral spillover and to assess whether these viruses pose a risk to human health.","['1 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.', '2 Centre for Tropical Medicine, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford University, Oxford, UK.', '3 Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', '4 Centre for Immunity, Infection & Evolution, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', '5 Health and Biosecurity, CSIRO, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Vic., Australia.', '6 The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.']","A Berto, P H Anh, J J Carrique-Mas, P Simmonds, N Van Cuong, N T Tue, N Van Dung, M E Woolhouse, I Smith, G A Marsh, J E Bryant, G E Thwaites, S Baker, M A Rabaa, VIZIONS consortium, ",Zoonoses and public health,NO_DATE,Viet Nam; bats; coronavirus; paramyxovirus; rats; zoonotic viruses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28418192

151,Isolation of Nipah virus from Malaysian Island flying-foxes,"In late 1998, Nipah virus emerged in peninsular Malaysia and caused fatal disease in domestic pigs and humans and substantial economic loss to the local pig industry. Surveillance of wildlife species during the outbreak showed neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus mainly in Island flying-foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) and Malayan flying-foxes (Pteropus vampyrus) but no virus reactive with anti-Nipah virus antibodies was isolated. We adopted a novel approach of collecting urine from these Island flying-foxes and swabs of their partially eaten fruits. Three viral isolates (two from urine and one from a partially eaten fruit swab) that caused Nipah virus-like syncytial cytopathic effect in Vero cells and stained strongly with Nipah- and Hendra-specific antibodies were isolated. Molecular sequencing and analysis of the 11,200-nucleotide fragment representing the beginning of the nucleocapsid gene to the end of the glycoprotein gene of one isolate confirmed the isolate to be Nipah virus with a sequence deviation of five to six nucleotides from Nipah virus isolated from humans. The isolation of Nipah virus from the Island flying-fox corroborates the serological evidence that it is one of the natural hosts of the virus.","['1 Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, 50603 Lumpur, Kuala, Malaysia']","Kaw Bing Chua, Chong Lek Koh, Poh Sim Hooi, Kong Fatt Wee, Jenn Hui Khong, Beng Hooi Chua, Yee Peng Chan, Mou Eng Lim, Sai Kit Lam, ",Microbes and infection,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11880045
152,Isolation and identification of a natural reassortant mammalian orthoreovirus from least horseshoe bat in China,"Background:
        
      
      Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) have a wide geographic distribution and can infect virtually all mammals. Infections in humans may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. This study describes the isolation and identification of a natural reassortant MRV from least horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus pusillu) in China, referred to as RpMRV-YN2012. Methods and results:
        
      
      The RpMRV-YN2012 was obtained from urine samples of Rhinolophus pusillus by cell culture. Negative-staining electron microscopy revealed that RpMRV-YN2012 was a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with ∼75 nm in diameter. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) migration patterns of the genome segments showed that RpMRV-YN2012 contained 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. The whole genome sequence of RpMRV2012 was determined. The consensus terminal sequences of all segments of 5'-GCUAh…yUCAUC-3' (h = A, U or C; y = C or U) were similar to the MRV species within the genus Orthoreovirus. Its evolution and evidence of genetic reassortment were analyzed by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel serotype 2 MRV that may have originated from reassortment among bat, human, and/or pig MRV strains which associated with diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in animals and humans. Conclusions:
        
      
      RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel bat reassortant MRV, which may have resulted from a reassortment involving MRVs known to infect humans and animals. It is necessary to identify whether RpMRV-YN2012 is associated with diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in clinical patients.

154,Evidence of two Lyssavirus phylogroups with distinct pathogenicity and immunogenicity,"The genetic diversity of representative members of the Lyssavirus genus (rabies and rabies-related viruses) was evaluated using the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the virus-host interaction, immunogenicity, and pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished seven genotypes, which could be divided into two major phylogroups having the highest bootstrap values. Phylogroup I comprises the worldwide genotype 1 (classic Rabies virus), the European bat lyssavirus (EBL) genotypes 5 (EBL1) and 6 (EBL2), the African genotype 4 (Duvenhage virus), and the Australian bat lyssavirus genotype 7. Phylogroup II comprises the divergent African genotypes 2 (Lagos bat virus) and 3 (Mokola virus). We studied immunogenic and pathogenic properties to investigate the biological significance of this phylogenetic grouping. Viruses from phylogroup I (Rabies virus and EBL1) were found to be pathogenic for mice when injected by the intracerebral or the intramuscular route, whereas viruses from phylogroup II (Mokola and Lagos bat viruses) were only pathogenic by the intracerebral route. We showed that the glycoprotein R333 residue essential for virulence was naturally replaced by a D333 in the phylogroup II viruses, likely resulting in their attenuated pathogenicity. Moreover, cross-neutralization distinguished the same phylogroups. Within each phylogroup, the amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein ectodomain was at least 74% identical, and antiglycoprotein virus-neutralizing antibodies displayed cross-neutralization. Between phylogroups, the identity was less than 64.5% and the cross-neutralization was absent, explaining why the classical rabies vaccines (phylogroup I) cannot protect against lyssaviruses from phylogroup II. Our tree-axial analysis divided lyssaviruses into two phylogroups that more closely reflect their biological characteristics than previous serotypes and genotypes.","['1 Laboratoire des Lyssavirus, Department of Virology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']","H Badrane, C Bahloul, P Perrin, N Tordo, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11238853

156,Discovery of Novel Bat Coronaviruses in South China That Use the Same Receptor as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has represented a human health threat since 2012. Although several MERS-related CoVs that belong to the same species as MERS-CoV have been identified from bats, they do not use the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we screened 1,059 bat samples from at least 30 bat species collected in different regions in south China and identified 89 strains of lineage C betacoronaviruses, including Tylonycteris pachypus coronavirus HKU4, Pipistrellus pipistrelluscoronavirus HKU5, and MERS-related CoVs. We sequenced the full-length genomes of two positive samples collected from the great evening bat, Ia io, from Guangdong Province. The two genomes were highly similar and exhibited genomic structures identical to those of other lineage C betacoronaviruses. While they exhibited genome-wide nucleotide identities of only 75.3 to 81.2% with other MERS-related CoVs, their gene-coding regions were highly similar to their counterparts, except in the case of the spike proteins. Further protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that the spike proteins of these MERS-related CoVs bind to the receptor DPP4. Recombination analysis suggested that the newly discovered MERS-related CoVs have acquired their spike genes from a DPP4-recognizing bat coronavirus HKU4. Our study provides further evidence that bats represent the evolutionary origins of MERS-CoV.IMPORTANCE Previous studies suggested that MERS-CoV originated in bats. However, its evolutionary path from bats to humans remains unclear. In this study, we discovered 89 novel lineage C betacoronaviruses in eight bat species. We provide evidence of a MERS-related CoV derived from the great evening bat that uses the same host receptor as human MERS-CoV. This virus also provides evidence for a natural recombination event between the bat MERS-related CoV and another bat coronavirus, HKU4. Our study expands the host ranges of MERS-related CoV and represents an important step toward establishing bats as the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV. These findings may lead to improved epidemiological surveillance of MERS-CoV and the prevention and control of the spread of MERS-CoV to humans.","['1 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', '3 Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA.', '4 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, New York, USA.', '5 Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA lifang@umn.edu zlshi@wh.iov.cn.', '6 CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China lifang@umn.edu zlshi@wh.iov.cn.']","Chu-Ming Luo, Ning Wang, Xing-Lou Yang, Hai-Zhou Liu, Wei Zhang, Bei Li, Ben Hu, Cheng Peng, Qi-Bin Geng, Guang-Jian Zhu, Fang Li, Zheng-Li Shi, ",Journal of virology,2018,MERS-related coronavirus; bat; dipeptidyl peptidase 4; virus discovery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29669833

PCR analyses were performed using COnsensus-DEgenerate Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primers (CODEHOPs) targeting the herpesvirus DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene. Although we obtained PCR products with CODEHOPs, direct sequencing using the primers was not possible because of high degree of degeneracy. Direct sequencing technology developed in our rapid determination system of viral RNA sequences (RDV) was applied in this study, and a partial DPOL nucleotide sequence was determined.

158,Two decades of one health surveillance of Nipah virus in Thailand,"Background:
        
      
      Nipah virus (NiV) infection causes encephalitis and has > 75% mortality rate, making it a WHO priority pathogen due to its pandemic potential. There have been NiV outbreak(s) in Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, and southern Philippines. NiV naturally circulates among fruit bats of the genus Pteropus and has been detected widely across Southeast and South Asia. Both Malaysian and Bangladeshi NiV strains have been found in fruit bats in Thailand. This study summarizes 20 years of pre-emptive One Health surveillance of NiV in Thailand, including triangulated surveillance of bats, and humans and pigs in the vicinity of roosts inhabited by NiV-infected bats. Methods:
        
      
      Samples were collected periodically and tested for NiV from bats, pigs and healthy human volunteers from Wat Luang village, Chonburi province, home to the biggest P. lylei roosts in Thailand, and other provinces since 2001. Archived cerebrospinal fluid specimens from encephalitis patients between 2001 and 2012 were also tested for NiV. NiV RNA was detected using nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). NiV antibodies were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or multiplex microsphere immunoassay. Results:
        
      
      NiV RNA (mainly Bangladesh strain) was detected every year in fruit bats by RT-PCR from 2002 to 2020. The whole genome sequence of NiV directly sequenced from bat urine in 2017 shared 99.17% identity to NiV from a Bangladeshi patient in 2004. No NiV-specific IgG antibodies or RNA have been found in healthy volunteers, encephalitis patients, or pigs to date. During the sample collection trips, 100 community members were trained on how to live safely with bats. Conclusions:
        
      
      High identity shared between the NiV genome from Thai bats and the Bangladeshi patient highlights the outbreak potential of NiV in Thailand. Results from NiV cross-sectoral surveillance were conveyed to national authorities and villagers which led to preventive control measures, increased surveillance of pigs and humans in vicinity of known NiV-infected roosts, and increased vigilance and reduced risk behaviors at the community level. This proactive One Health approach to NiV surveillance is a success story; that increased collaboration between the human, animal, and wildlife sectors is imperative to staying ahead of a zoonotic disease outbreak.","['1 Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases - Health Science Centre and WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Rama IV Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. spwa@hotmail.com.', '2 Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases - Health Science Centre and WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training on Viral Zoonoses, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Rama IV Road, Pathumwan, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.', '3 Forest Biology Department, Faculty of Forestry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '4 Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok, Thailand.', '5 Bureau of Disease Control and Veterinary Services, Department of Livestock Development, Bangkok, Thailand.', '6 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '7 Center of Excellence in Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases in Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University (CU-EIDAs), Bangkok, Thailand.', '8 National Institute of Animal Health, Department of Livestock Development, Bangkok, Thailand.', '9 Program in Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', '10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Bangkok, Thailand.', '11 Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.', '12 U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia, Bangkok, Thailand.', '13 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, USA.', '14 Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Biological Threat Reduction Program, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, USA.']","Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, Siriporn Ghai, Prateep Duengkae, Pattarapol Manee-Orn, Weerapong Thanapongtharm, Abhinbhen W Saraya, Sangchai Yingsakmongkon, Yutthana Joyjinda, Sanipa Suradhat, Weenassarin Ampoot, Bundit Nuansrichay, Thongchai Kaewpom, Rachod Tantilertcharoen, Apaporn Rodpan, Kachen Wongsathapornchai, Teerada Ponpinit, Rome Buathong, Saowalak Bunprakob, Sudarat Damrongwatanapokin, Chanida Ruchiseesarod, Sininat Petcharat, Wantanee Kalpravidh, Kevin J Olival, Martha M Stokes, Thiravat Hemachudha, ",One health outlook,2021,Nipah virus; One health; Outbreak; Pteropus; Surveillance; Thailand.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218820
159,"Population genetics of fruit bat reservoir informs the dynamics, distribution and diversity of Nipah virus","The structure and connectivity of wildlife host populations may influence zoonotic disease dynamics, evolution and therefore spillover risk to people. Fruit bats in the genus Pteropus, or flying foxes, are the primary natural reservoir for henipaviruses-a group of emerging paramyxoviruses that threaten livestock and public health. In Bangladesh, Pteropus medius is the reservoir for Nipah virus-and viral spillover has led to human fatalities nearly every year since 2001. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite markers to measure the population structure, demographic history and phylogeography of P. medius in Bangladesh. We combine this with a phylogeographic analysis of all known Nipah virus sequences and strains currently available to better inform the dynamics, distribution and evolutionary history of Nipah virus. We show that P. medius is primarily panmictic, but combined analysis of microsatellite and morphological data shows evidence for differentiation of two populations in eastern Bangladesh, corresponding to a divergent strain of Nipah virus also found in bats from eastern Bangladesh. Our demographic analyses indicate that a large, expanding population of flying foxes has existed in Bangladesh since the Late Pleistocene, coinciding with human population expansion in South Asia, suggesting repeated historical spillover of Nipah virus likely occurred. We present the first evidence of mitochondrial introgression, or hybridization, between P. medius and flying fox species found in South-East Asia (P. vampyrus and P. hypomelanus), which may help to explain the distribution of Nipah virus strains across the region.","['1 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY, USA.', '2 Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, USA.', '3 ICDDR,b, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']","Kevin J Olival, Alice Latinne, Ariful Islam, Jonathan H Epstein, Rebecca Hersch, Rachel C Engstrand, Emily S Gurley, George Amato, Stephen P Luby, Peter Daszak, ",Molecular ecology,NO_DATE,Pteropus giganteus; Chiroptera; dispersal; emerging infectious disease; phylogeography; population genetic structure; zoonoses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31652377

The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals. Here, we report the identification of a novel bat coronavirus through surveillance of coronaviruses in wildlife. Analyses of the RNA sequence from the ORF1b and S-gene regions indicated that the virus is a group 1 coronavirus. The virus was detected in fecal and respiratory samples from three bat species (Miniopterus spp.). In particular, 63% (12 of 19) of fecal samples from Miniopterus pusillus were positive for the virus. These findings suggest that this virus might be commonly circulating in M. pusillus in Hong Kong.","[""1 Department of Microbiology, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China. llmpoon@hkucc.hku.hk""]","L L M Poon, D K W Chu, K H Chan, O K Wong, T M Ellis, Y H C Leung, S K P Lau, P C Y Woo, K Y Suen, K Y Yuen, Y Guan, J S M Peiris, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15681402
161,Quantifying antigenic relationships among the lyssaviruses,"All lyssaviruses cause fatal encephalitis in mammals. There is sufficient antigenic variation within the genus to cause variable vaccine efficacy, but this variation is difficult to characterize quantitatively: sequence analysis cannot yet provide detailed antigenic information, and antigenic neutralization data have been refractory to high-resolution robust interpretation. Here, we address these issues by using state-of-the-art antigenic analyses to generate a high-resolution antigenic map of a global panel of 25 lyssaviruses. We compared the calculated antigenic distances with viral glycoprotein ectodomain sequence data. Although 67% of antigenic variation was predictable from the glycoprotein amino acid sequence, there are in some cases substantial differences between genetic and antigenic distances, thus highlighting the risk of inferring antigenic relationships solely from sequence data at this time. These differences included epidemiologically important antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type rabies viruses. Further, we quantitatively assessed the antigenic relationships measured by using rabbit, mouse, and human sera, validating the use of nonhuman experimental animals as a model for determining antigenic variation in humans. The use of passive immune globulin is a crucial component of rabies postexposure prophylaxis, and here we also show that it is possible to predict the reactivity of immune globulin against divergent lyssaviruses.","['1 Rabies and Wildlife Zoonoses, Veterinary Laboratories Agency Weybridge, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 3NB, UK. d.horton@vla.defra.gsi.gov.uk']","D L Horton, L M McElhinney, D A Marston, J L N Wood, C A Russell, N Lewis, I V Kuzmin, R A M Fouchier, A D M E Osterhaus, A R Fooks, D J Smith, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20826698

In vitro studies revealed similar cell permissiveness and replication of CSUR381 (compared with 2 other NiV isolates) in both bat and human cell lines. Sequence alignments indicated conservation of the ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 receptor binding sites, the glycosylation site on the G attachment protein, as well as the editing site in phosphoprotein, suggesting production of nonstructural proteins V and W, known to counteract the host innate immunity. In the hamster animal model, CSUR381 induced lethal infections.

Overall, 2.4% of bats tested positive for the presence of at least two viruses, only on Madagascar and in Mozambique. Significant variation in the proportion of co-infections was detected among bat species, and some combinations of co-infection were more common than others.

It has been reported that human bufavirus was detected predominantly in patients with diarrhoea in several countries. However, little is known about bufavirus or its close relatives in nonhuman mammals. In this study, we performed nested-PCR screening and identified bufavirus from 12 megabats of Pteropus spp. in Indonesia. Furthermore, we determined nearly the full genome sequence of a novel megabat-borne bufavirus, tentatively named megabat bufavirus 1. Phylogenetic analyses showed that megabat bufavirus 1 clustered with known protoparvoviruses, including human bufavirus but represented a distinct lineage of bufavirus. Our analyses also inferred phylogenetic relationships among animal-borne bufaviruses recently reported by other studies. Recombination analyses suggested that the most common recent ancestor of megabat bufavirus 1 might have arisen from multiple genetic recombination events. These results characterized megabat bufavirus 1 as the first protoparvovirus discovered from megabats and indicates the high genetic divergence of bufavirus.","['1 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', '2 Division of Bioinformatics, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', '3 Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bogor Agricultural University, Bogor, Indonesia.', '4 Veterinary Investigation and Diagnostic Center, Bukittinggi, Indonesia.', '5 Faculty of Agriculture, Gorontalo State University, Gorontalo, Indonesia.', '6 Faculty of Animal Husbandry, Sam Ratulangi University, Manado, Indonesia.', '7 Office of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, Soppeng, Indonesia.', '8 Veterinary Medicine Study Program, Faculty of Medicine, Hasanudin University, Makassar, Indonesia.', '9 Unit of International Cooperation, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', '10 Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', '11 Global Virus Network, Baltimore, MD, USA.']","Michihito Sasaki, Gabriel Gonzalez, Yuji Wada, Agus Setiyono, Ekowati Handharyani, Ibenu Rahmadani, Siswatiana Taha, Sri Adiani, Munira Latief, Zainal Abidin Kholilullah, Mawar Subangkit, Shintaro Kobayashi, Ichiro Nakamura, Takashi Kimura, Yasuko Orba, Kimihito Ito, Hirofumi Sawa, ",Scientific reports,2016,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27113297

Improving our understanding on the role of bats in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus.

Our study encompassed data from 12 countries collected over a time span of 35 years and focused on the glycoprotein (G) and nucleoprotein (N) genes. We show that although the two subtypes of EBLV-1--EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b--have both grown at a low exponential rate since their introduction into Europe, they have differing population structures and dispersal patterns. Furthermore, there were strong constraints against amino acid change in both EBLV-1 and EBLV-2, as reflected in a low ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site, particularly in EBLV-1b. Our inferred rate of nucleotide substitution in EBLV-1, approximately 5 x 10(-5) substitutions per site per year, was also one of the lowest recorded for RNA viruses and implied that the current genetic diversity in the virus arose 500 to 750 years ago.

171,Identification of a novel bat papillomavirus by metagenomics,"The discovery of novel viruses in animals expands our knowledge of viral diversity and potentially emerging zoonoses. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology gives millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a comprehensive survey of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we screened 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattles (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11) and monkeys (n = 20) using a HTS metagenomics approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a specimen from a Common Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii). It is about 7.5kb in length, with a G+C content of 45.8% and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related. Estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was approximately 60.2-91.9 millions of years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes. The estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from co-divergence because of possible host shifts. As the nucleotide sequence of this virus only showed limited similarity with that of related animal PVs, the conventional approach of PCR using consensus primers would be unlikely to have detected the novel virus in the sample. Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no apparent mucosal or skin lesions whereas RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the novel Dyolambda-papillomavirus genus.","['1 State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong.']","Herman Tse, Alan K L Tsang, Hoi-Wah Tsoi, Andy S P Leung, Chi-Chun Ho, Susanna K P Lau, Patrick C Y Woo, Kwok-Yung Yuen, ",PloS one,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22937142
172,"Phylogeny and origins of hantaviruses harbored by bats, insectivores, and rodents","Hantaviruses are among the most important zoonotic pathogens of humans and the subject of heightened global attention. Despite the importance of hantaviruses for public health, there is no consensus on their evolutionary history and especially the frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species virus transmission. Documenting the extent of hantavirus biodiversity, and particularly their range of mammalian hosts, is critical to resolving this issue. Here, we describe four novel hantaviruses (Huangpi virus, Lianghe virus, Longquan virus, and Yakeshi virus) sampled from bats and shrews in China, and which are distinct from other known hantaviruses. Huangpi virus was found in Pipistrellus abramus, Lianghe virus in Anourosorex squamipes, Longquan virus in Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus sinicus, and Rhinolophus monoceros, and Yakeshi virus in Sorex isodon, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the available diversity of hantaviruses reveals the existence of four phylogroups that infect a range of mammalian hosts, as well as the occurrence of ancient reassortment events between the phylogroups. Notably, the phylogenetic histories of the viruses are not always congruent with those of their hosts, suggesting that cross-species transmission has played a major role during hantavirus evolution and at all taxonomic levels, although we also noted some evidence for virus-host co-divergence. Our phylogenetic analysis also suggests that hantaviruses might have first appeared in Chiroptera (bats) or Soricomorpha (moles and shrews), before emerging in rodent species.

Here, we examine the influence of host crowding and population age structure on pathogen transmission and diversity in bat populations. Focusing on two pathogen taxa of medical importance, Leptospira bacteria and paramyxoviruses, we monitored host population and pathogen shedding dynamics within a maternity colony of the tropical bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Réunion Island. Our data reveal astonishingly similar infection dynamics for Leptospira and paramyxoviruses, with infection peaks during late pregnancy and 2 months after the initial birth pulse. Furthermore, although co-infection occurs frequently during the peaks of transmission, the patterns do not suggest any interaction between the two pathogens. Partial sequencing reveals a unique bat-specific Leptospira strain contrasting with the co-circulation of four separate paramyxovirus lineages along the whole breeding period. Patterns of infection highlight the importance of host crowding in pathogen transmission and suggest that most bats developed immune response and stop excreting pathogens. Our results support that bat maternity colonies may represent hot spots of transmission for bacterial and viral infectious agents, and highlight how seasonality can be an important determinant of host-parasite interactions and disease emergence.","[""1 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Émergentes dans l'Océan Indien, France."", '2 Université de La Réunion, France.', '3 Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Sainte Clotilde, France.', '4 Joint Chair Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Université de La Réunion, Sainte Clotilde, France.']","Muriel Dietrich, David A Wilkinson, Aude Benlali, Erwan Lagadec, Beza Ramasindrazana, Koussay Dellagi, Pablo Tortosa, ",Environmental microbiology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25580582
174,Highly divergent cyclo-like virus in a great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger) in Vietnam,"Members of the viral family Circoviridae are increasingly recognized worldwide. Bats seem to be natural reservoirs or dietary-related dispensers of these viruses. Here, we report a distantly related member of the genus Cyclovirus detected in the faeces of a great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger). Interestingly, the novel virus lacks a Circoviridae-specific stem-loop structure, although a Geminiviridae-like nonamer sequence was detected in the large intergenic region. Based on these differences and its phylogenetic position, we propose that our new virus represents a distant and highly divergent member of the genus Cyclovirus. However it is lacking several characteristics of members of the genus, which raises a challenge in its taxonomic classification.","['1 Virological Research Group, Szentágothai Research Centre, University of Pécs, Ifjúság út 20, 7624, Pécs, Hungary.', '2 Institute of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary.', '3 Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam.', '4 Department of Zoology, Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, Hungary.', '5 Department of Zoology, Eszterházy Károly University, Eger, Hungary.', '6 Microbial Biotechnology Research Group, Szentágothai Reasearch Centre, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary.', '7 Department of General and Environmental Microbiology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary.', '8 Institute for Veterinary Medical Research Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '9 Virological Research Group, Szentágothai Research Centre, University of Pécs, Ifjúság út 20, 7624, Pécs, Hungary. jakabf@gamma.ttk.pte.hu.', '10 Institute of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary. jakabf@gamma.ttk.pte.hu.']","Gábor Kemenesi, Kornélia Kurucz, Brigitta Zana, Vuong Tan Tu, Tamás Görföl, Péter Estók, Fanni Földes, Katalin Sztancsik, Péter Urbán, Enikő Fehér, Ferenc Jakab, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,CRESS DNA virus; Guano; Hipposideridae; Nucleotide composition analysis; ssDNA.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28447216
175,A real-time RT-PCR method for the universal detection and identification of flaviviruses,"Here we describe an optimized molecular protocol for the universal detection and identification of flaviviruses. It combines the convenient real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) format with a broad spectrum of flavivirus detection. This assay, based on the amplification of a 269-272 nt (depending on the flavivirus tested) region at the N terminal end of the NS5 gene, enabled the amplification of 51 flavivirus species and 3 tentative species. Sequencing of the amplicons produced by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR permitted the reliable taxonomic identification of flavivirus species by comparison with reference sequences available in databases, using either the BLASTN algorithm or a simple phylogenetic reconstruction. The limit of detection of the assay (2-20,500 copies/reaction depending on the virus tested) allowed the detection of different flaviviruses from a series of human sera or veterinary samples. Altogether, the characteristics of this technique make it a good candidate for the identification of previously identified flaviviruses in cell culture and the investigation of field samples, and also a promising tool for the discovery and identification of new species, including viruses distantly related to ""classical"" arthropod-borne flaviviruses.","['1 Unité des Virus Emergents, Faculté de Médecine, Marseille, France.']","G Moureau, S Temmam, J P Gonzalez, R N Charrel, G Grard, X de Lamballerie, ","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18020965
176,Molecular characterization of human pathogenic bunyaviruses of the Nyando and Bwamba/Pongola virus groups leads to the genetic identification of Mojuí dos Campos and Kaeng Khoi virus,"Background:
        
      
      Human infection with Bwamba virus (BWAV) and the closely related Pongola virus (PGAV), as well as Nyando virus (NDV), are important causes of febrile illness in Africa. However, despite seroprevalence studies that indicate high rates of infection in many countries, these viruses remain relatively unknown and unstudied. In addition, a number of unclassified bunyaviruses have been isolated over the years often with uncertain relationships to human disease. Methodology/principal findings:
        
      
      In order to better understand the genetic and evolutionary relationships among orthobunyaviruses associated with human disease, we have sequenced the complete genomes for all 3 segments of multiple strains of BWAV (n = 2), PGAV (n = 2) and NDV (n = 4), as well as the previously unclassified Mojuí dos Campos (MDCV) and Kaeng Khoi viruses (KKV). Based on phylogenetic analysis, we show that these viruses populate 2 distinct branches, one made up of BWAV and PGAV and the other composed of NDV, MDCV and KKV. Interestingly, the NDV strains analyzed form two distinct clades which differed by >10% on the amino acid level across all protein products. In addition, the assignment of two bat-associated bunyaviruses into the NDV group, which is clearly associated with mosquito-borne infection, led us to analyze the ability of these different viruses to grow in bat (RE05 and Tb 1 Lu) and mosquito (C6/36) cell lines, and indeed all the viruses tested were capable of efficient growth in these cell types. Conclusions/significance:
        
      
      On the basis of our analyses, it is proposed to reclassify the NDV strains ERET147 and YM176-66 as a new virus species. Further, our analysis definitively identifies the previously unclassified bunyaviruses MDCV and KKV as distinct species within the NDV group and suggests that these viruses may have a broader host range than is currently appreciated.","['1 Molecular Virology and Host-Pathogen Interaction Unit, Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, United States of America.', '2 RML Genomics Unit, Research Technology Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, United States of America.', '3 Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America.', '4 Department of Pathology and Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America.']","Allison Groseth, Veena Mampilli, Carla Weisend, Eric Dahlstrom, Stephen F Porcella, Brandy J Russell, Robert B Tesh, Hideki Ebihara, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2014,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25188437
177,Isolation of Kaeng Khoi virus from dead Chaerephon plicata bats in Cambodia,"A virus isolated from dead Chaerephon plicata bats collected near Kampot, Cambodia, was identified as a member of the family Bunyaviridae by electron microscopy. The only bunyavirus previously isolated from Chaerephon species bats in South-East Asia is Kaeng Khoi (KK) virus (genus Orthobunyavirus), detected in Thailand over 30 years earlier and implicated as a public health problem. Using RT-PCR, nucleotide sequences from the M RNA segment of several virus isolates from the Cambodian C. plicata bats were found to be almost identical and to differ from those of the prototype KK virus by only 2.6-3.2 %, despite the temporal and geographic separation of the viruses. These results identify the Cambodian bat viruses as KK virus, extend the known virus geographic range and document the first KK virus isolation in 30 years. These genetic data, together with earlier serologic data, show that KK viruses represent a distinct group within the genus Orthobunyavirus.","['1 Special Pathogens Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.', '2 Viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.', '3 Infectious Disease Pathology Activity, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.', '4 National Institute of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Kingdom of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.']","J C Osborne, C E Rupprecht, J G Olson, T G Ksiazek, P E Rollin, M Niezgoda, C S Goldsmith, U S An, S T Nichol, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13679602
178,Genomic diversity and evolution of the lyssaviruses,"Lyssaviruses are RNA viruses with single-strand, negative-sense genomes responsible for rabies-like diseases in mammals. To date, genomic and evolutionary studies have most often utilized partial genome sequences, particularly of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes, with little consideration of genome-scale evolution. Herein, we report the first genomic and evolutionary analysis using complete genome sequences of all recognised lyssavirus genotypes, including 14 new complete genomes of field isolates from 6 genotypes and one genotype that is completely sequenced for the first time. In doing so we significantly increase the extent of genome sequence data available for these important viruses. Our analysis of these genome sequence data reveals that all lyssaviruses have the same genomic organization. A phylogenetic analysis reveals strong geographical structuring, with the greatest genetic diversity in Africa, and an independent origin for the two known genotypes that infect European bats. We also suggest that multiple genotypes may exist within the diversity of viruses currently classified as 'Lagos Bat'. In sum, we show that rigorous phylogenetic techniques based on full length genome sequence provide the best discriminatory power for genotype classification within the lyssaviruses.","['1 Institut Pasteur, UPRE Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rabies, Paris, France.']","Olivier Delmas, Edward C Holmes, Chiraz Talbi, Florence Larrous, Laurent Dacheux, Christiane Bouchier, Hervé Bourhy, ",PloS one,2008,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18446239
179,"Synchronized shift of oral, faecal and urinary microbiotas in bats and natural infection dynamics during seasonal reproduction","Seasonal reproduction is a period of extreme physiological and behavioural changes, yet we know little about how it may affect host microbial communities (i.e. microbiota) and pathogen transmission. Here, we investigated shifts of the bacterial microbiota in saliva, urine and faeces during the seasonal reproduction of bats in South Africa, and test for an interaction in shedding patterns of both bacterial (Leptospira) and viral (adeno- and herpesviruses) agents. Based on a comparative approach in two cave-dwelling bat species and high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we demonstrated a clear signature in microbiota changes over the reproduction season, consistent across the multiple body habitats investigated, and associated with the sex, age and reproductive condition of bats. We observed in parallel highly dynamic shedding patterns for both bacteria and viruses, but did not find a significant association between viral shedding and bacterial microbiota composition. Indeed, only Leptospira shedding was associated with alterations in both the diversity and composition of the urinary microbiota. These results illustrate how seasonal reproduction in bats substantially affects microbiota composition and infection dynamics, and have broad implications for the understanding of disease ecology in important reservoir hosts, such as bats.","['1 Centre for Viral Zoonoses, Department of Medical Virology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '2 Ditsong National Museum of Natural History, Pretoria, South Africa.', '3 School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '4 AfricanBats NPC, Kloofsig, South Africa.', '5 Wildlife Management, Mammal Research Institute, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '6 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Sandringham, South Africa.']","Muriel Dietrich, Teresa Kearney, Ernest C J Seamark, Janusz T Paweska, Wanda Markotter, ",Royal Society open science,2018,South Africa; bacteria; bats; microbiota; reproduction; virus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29892443
180,Genetic diversity of coronaviruses in Miniopterus fuliginosus bats,"Coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pose significant public health threats. Bats have been suggested to act as natural reservoirs for both these viruses, and periodic monitoring of coronaviruses in bats may thus provide important clues about emergent infectious viruses. The Eastern bent-wing bat Miniopterus fuliginosus is distributed extensively throughout China. We therefore analyzed the genetic diversity of coronaviruses in samples of M. fuliginosus collected from nine Chinese provinces during 2011-2013. The only coronavirus genus found was Alphacoronavirus. We established six complete and five partial genomic sequences of alphacoronaviruses, which revealed that they could be divided into two distinct lineages, with close relationships to coronaviruses in Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus. Recombination was confirmed by detecting putative breakpoints of Lineage 1 coronaviruses in M. fuliginosus and M. pusillus (Wu et al., 2015), which supported the results of topological and phylogenetic analyses. The established alphacoronavirus genome sequences showed high similarity to other alphacoronaviruses found in other Miniopterus species, suggesting that their transmission in different Miniopterus species may provide opportunities for recombination with different alphacoronaviruses. The genetic information for these novel alphacoronaviruses will improve our understanding of the evolution and genetic diversity of coronaviruses, with potentially important implications for the transmission of human diseases.","['1 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100176, China.', '2 State Key Laboratory of Estuarine and Coastal Research, Institute of Estuarine and Coastal Research, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200062, China.', '3 College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China.', '4 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100176, China. wuzq2009@ipbcams.ac.cn.', '5 MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100176, China. zdsys@vip.sina.com.', '6 Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, 310003, China. zdsys@vip.sina.com.']","Jiang Du, Li Yang, Xianwen Ren, Junpeng Zhang, Jie Dong, Lilian Sun, Yafang Zhu, Fan Yang, Shuyi Zhang, Zhiqiang Wu, Qi Jin, ",Science China.

We extracted RNA from 312 spleen samples from bats captured in Zambia over a period of 4 years (2008-2011). Semi-nested RT-PCR detected a total of 25 (8%) positive samples for paramyxoviruses which were then directly sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic analysis. Among the positive samples, seven novel paramyxoviruses were detected. Five viruses were closely related to the genus Henipavirus, while two viruses were related to the unclassified Bat paramyxoviruses from Ghana and Congo Brazzaville. Our study identified novel Henipavirus-related and unrelated viruses using RT-PCR in fruit bats from Kansaka National Park and indicated the presence of similar Bat paramyxoviruses originating from wide geographic areas, suggesting the ability of bats to harbor and transmit viruses. The presence of these viruses in fruit bats might pose a public health risk.","['1 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.']","Walter Muleya, Michihito Sasaki, Yasuko Orba, Akihiro Ishii, Yuka Thomas, Emiko Nakagawa, Hirohito Ogawa, Bernard Hang'ombe, Boniface Namangala, Aaron Mweene, Ayato Takada, Takashi Kimura, Hirofumi Sawa, ",The Journal of veterinary medical science,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24389743
182,Dual Combined Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for the Diagnosis of Lyssavirus Infection,"The definitive diagnosis of lyssavirus infection (including rabies) in animals and humans is based on laboratory confirmation. The reference techniques for post-mortem rabies diagnosis are still based on direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation, but molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods, are increasingly being used and now constitute the principal tools for diagnosing rabies in humans and for epidemiological analyses. However, it remains a key challenge to obtain relevant specificity and sensitivity with these techniques while ensuring that the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses does not compromise detection. We developed a dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (combo RT-qPCR) method for pan-lyssavirus detection. This method is based on two complementary technologies: a probe-based (TaqMan) RT-qPCR for detecting the RABV species (pan-RABV RT-qPCR) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green) to detect other lyssavirus species (pan-lyssa RT-qPCR). The performance parameters of this combined assay were evaluated with a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all the genetic variability encountered at the viral species level, and they extended to almost all lyssavirus species characterized to date. This method was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples (positive n = 76 and negative n = 135) including saliva, skin and brain biopsies. It detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and the interest of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. Finally, this method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This combined RT-qPCR method constitutes a relevant, useful, validated tool for the diagnosis of rabies in both humans and animals, and represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance.","['1 Institut Pasteur, Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation Unit, National Reference Centre for Rabies, WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Paris, France.', '2 Institut Pasteur du Maroc, Medical Virology and BSL3 Laboratory, Casablanca, Morocco.', '3 Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Virology Unit, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.']","Laurent Dacheux, Florence Larrous, Rachel Lavenir, Anthony Lepelletier, Abdellah Faouzi, Cécile Troupin, Jalal Nourlil, Philippe Buchy, Herve Bourhy, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2016,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27380028

Importantly, we found that three of six bat MRV strains shared high similarity with MRVs isolated from diseased minks, piglets or humans based on the S1 segment, suggesting that interspecies transmission has occurred between bats and humans or animals. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 10 segments showed that the genomic segments of these bat MRVs had different evolution lineages, suggesting that these bat MRVs may have arisen through reassortment of MRVs of different origins.","['1 Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, PR China.', '2 Guangdong Entomological Institute, Guangzhou, PR China.']","Xing-Lou Yang, Bing Tan, Bo Wang, Wen Li, Ning Wang, Chu-Ming Luo, Mei-Niang Wang, Wei Zhang, Bei Li, Cheng Peng, Xing-Yi Ge, Li-Biao Zhang, Zheng-Li Shi, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26475793
184,Phylogenetic comparison of the genus Lyssavirus using distal coding sequences of the glycoprotein and nucleoprotein genes,"The phylogenetic relationships between all seven genotypes within the genus Lyssavirus were compared at the nucleotide level utilising two distal regions of the viral genome. The resulting analysis of each region produced similar, although not identical, phylogenetic results, suggesting that the evolutionary pressures on individual proteins within the genome vary. These differences are in part due to the increased variability observed within the glycoprotein sequence over the nucleoprotein sequence. Pair-wise comparison using the glycoprotein partial sequence between different isolates demonstrate that within genotypes, viruses show between 80 and 100% sequence identity, whilst between genotypes, viruses show between 50 and 75% identity. This provides a consistent guide to assigning new viruses to existing genotypes. Alignment of the amino acid sequence for the truncated glycoprotein sequence to the Pasteur Virus vaccine strain show significant residue variation between positions 139 and 170. However, residue variation tends to vary with genotype implying that these changes have not evolved due to immunological pressure from the host but have occurred following the separation of viruses into discrete groups. Comparison of the phylogenetic analysis for this partial region of the glycoprotein suggest that it gives comparable results to studies that have used larger regions of the Lyssavirus genome.","['1 Rabies Research and Diagnostic Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK. n.johnson2@vla.defra.gsi.gov.uk']","N Johnson, L M McElhinney, J Smith, P Lowings, A R Fooks, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12417947

The evolution of kobuviruses in different hosts was analysed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. We estimated and compared time of origin of kobuviruses in different host orders; we also examined the cross-species transmission of kobuviruses within the same host order and between different host orders. Our data provide new knowledge of rodent and bat kobuviruses, which are most closely related to human kobuviruses. The novel bat kobuviruses isolated from bat roosts in Southern Vietnam were genetically distinct from previously described bat kobuviruses, but closely related to kobuviruses found in rodents. We additionally found evidence of frequent cross-species transmissions of kobuviruses within rodents. Overall, our phylogenetic analyses reveal multiple cross-species transmissions both within and among mammalian species, which increases our understanding of kobuviruses genetic diversity and the complexity of their evolutionary history.","['1 Ashworth Laboratories, Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh, Kings Buildings, Charlotte Auerbach Road, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, UK.', '2 Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK.', '3 Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam.', '4 The Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, 764 Vo Van Kiet, W.1, Dist. 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', '5 The Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0SP, UK.']","Lu Lu, Nguyen Van Dung, Alasdair Ivens, Carlijn Bogaardt, Aine O'Toole, Juliet E Bryant, Juan Carrique-Mas, Nguyen Van Cuong, Pham Hong Anh, Maia A Rabaa, Ngo Tri Tue, Guy E Thwaites, Stephen Baker, Peter Simmonds, Mark Ej Woolhouse, VIZIONS Consortium, ",Virus evolution,2018,Bayesian phylogenetics; cross-species transmission; kobuvirus; next generation sequencing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29449965

A total of 947 bats were investigated originating from 52 capture sites (22 caves, 18 buildings, and 12 outdoor sites) distributed over different bioclimatic zones of the island. Using RT-PCR targeting the L-polymerase gene of the Paramyxoviridae family, we found that 10.5% of sampled bats were infected, representing six out of seven families and 15 out of 31 species analyzed. Univariate analysis indicates that both abiotic and biotic factors may promote viral infection. Using generalized linear modeling of UMRV infection overlaid on biotic and abiotic variables, we demonstrate that sympatric occurrence of bats is a major factor for virus transmission. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all paramyxoviruses infecting Malagasy bats are UMRVs and showed little host specificity. Analyses using the maximum parsimony reconciliation tool CoRe-PA, indicate that host-switching, rather than co-speciation, is the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism of UMRVs among Malagasy bats.","[""1 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Emergentes dans l'Océan Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, 2 rue Maxime Rivière, 97490 Sainte Clotilde, La Réunion, France."", '2 Université de La Réunion, UMR PIMIT ""Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical"", INSERM U1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249, Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, Saint Denis, La Réunion, France.', '3 Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), IRD - BP 50172, 97492 Sainte-Clotilde, La Réunion, France.', '4 University of Leipzig, Department of Computer Science, Augustusplatz 10, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.', '5 Association Vahatra, BP 3972, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar.', '6 Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, BP 1274 Ambohitrakely, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar.', ""7 UMR C53 CIRAD, Peuplements Végétaux et Bioagresseurs en Milieu Tropical, 7 chemin de l'IRAT, 97410 St Pierre, France."", '8 Université de La Réunion, 15 Avenue René Cassin, 97400 Saint-Denis, France.', '9 Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 S.

In the current study we investigated the genetic diversity of RVAs in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in Cameroon using viral metagenomics. Five (near) complete RVA genomes were obtained. A single RVA strain showed a partial relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain, whereas the other strains were completely novel. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed significant variability, indicating the occurrence of frequent reassortment events. Comparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that most of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel consensus screening primers were developed and used to screen samples from infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population.

Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that IRKV-THChina12 has the same genomic organization as other lyssaviruses and its isolation provides an independent origin for the species IRKV. Conclusions:
        
      
      We have identified the existence of a bat lyssavirus in a common Chinese bat species. Its high pathogenicity in adult mice suggests that public warnings and medical education regarding bat bites in China should be increased, and that surveillance be extended to provide a better understanding of Irkut virus ecology and its significance for public health.","['1 Laboratory of Epidemiology and Key Laboratory of Jilin Province for Zoonosis Prevention and Control, Military Veterinary Research Institute, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Jingyue Economy Development Zone, Changchun, China.']","Ye Liu, Shoufeng Zhang, Jinghui Zhao, Fei Zhang, Rongliang Hu, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23505588

190,Detection of novel coronaviruses in bats in Myanmar,"The recent emergence of bat-borne zoonotic viruses warrants vigilant surveillance in their natural hosts. Of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses, which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction. Sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses. Three novel alphacoronaviruses, three novel betacoronaviruses, and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast Asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in Myanmar. Ongoing land use change remains a prominent driver of zoonotic disease emergence in Myanmar, bringing humans into ever closer contact with wildlife, and justifying continued surveillance and vigilance at broad scales.","[""1 Global Health Program, Smithsonian's National Zoological Park and Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, District of Columbia, United States of America."", '2 Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, Naypyitaw, Myanmar.', '3 One Health Institute, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, California, United States of America.']","Marc T Valitutto, Ohnmar Aung, Kyaw Yan Naing Tun, Megan E Vodzak, Dawn Zimmerman, Jennifer H Yu, Ye Tun Win, Min Thein Maw, Wai Zin Thein, Htay Htay Win, Jasjeet Dhanota, Victoria Ontiveros, Brett Smith, Alexandre Tremeau-Brevard, Tracey Goldstein, Christine K Johnson, Suzan Murray, Jonna Mazet, ",PloS one,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32271768

We also compared the bat JEV isolates with other JEV isolates available from GenBank to determine their genetic similarity. We found a high genetic homogeneity among the bat JEVs isolated in different geographical areas from various bat species at different time periods. All eight bat JEV isolates belonged to genotype III. The mean evolutionary rate of bat JEV isolates was lower than those of isolates of other origin, but this difference was not statistically significant. Based on these results, we presume that the bat JEV isolates might be evolutionarily conserved. The eight bat JEV isolates were phylogenetically similar to mosquito BN19 and human Liyujie isolates of JEV. These results indicate that bats might be involved in natural cycle of JEV.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Southern Medical University, 1838 Guangzhou North Road, Guangzhou, 510515, Guangdong, China.']","Shan Liu, Xing Li, Zhiyong Chen, Yixiong Chen, Qionghua Zhang, Yuxue Liao, Jie Zhou, Xuemei Ke, Lizhen Ma, Jianpeng Xiao, Yi Wu, Zhong Chen, Junhua Zhou, Xueyan Zheng, Jiandong Li, Qing Chen, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23836395
192,Influence of age and body condition on astrovirus infection of bats in Singapore: An evolutionary and epidemiological analysis,"Bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity. Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.","['1 Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, 8 College Rd, 169857, Singapore.', '2 College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', '3 National Parks Board, 1 Cluny Rd, Singapore 259569.', '4 Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, United States.']","Ian H Mendenhall, Maggie M Skiles, Erica Sena Neves, Sophie A Borthwick, Dolyce H W Low, Benjamin Liang, Benjamin P Y-H Lee, Yvonne C F Su, Gavin J D Smith, ","One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2017,Bat borne virus; Eonycteris spelaea; Epidemiology; Phylogenetics; Pooling prevalence; Rhinolophus lepidus; Southeast Asia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29159263
193,Isolation and characterization of a novel alphaherpesvirus in fruit bats,"Bats are known to harbor emerging RNA viruses. Recent studies have used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify various virus species, including DNA viruses that are harbored by bats; however, little is known about the nature of these potentially novel viruses. Here, we report the characterization of a novel herpesvirus isolated from an Indonesian pteropodid bat. The virus, tentatively named fruit bat alphaherpesvirus 1 (FBAHV1), has a double-stranded DNA genome of 149,459 bp. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that FBAHV1 is phylogenetically grouped with simplexviruses within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Inoculation of FBAHV1 into laboratory mice caused a lethal infection. Virus infection was observed in lung, liver, and brain tissue. Serological and PCR screening revealed that fruit bats infected with FBAHV1 or its related virus are widely distributed in Indonesia. The identification of FBAHV1 makes a considerable contribution to our understanding of simplexviruses associated with bats. Importance:
        
      
      Bats are known to harbor emerging viruses, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, and filoviruses. Although alphaherpesviruses are disseminated in humans and other animals, there is little information about their distribution in bats. Here, we isolated a previously unknown alphaherpesvirus from an Indonesian fruit bat. Genome sequence analysis suggested that the virus is a member of the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which also includes common human viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2. FBAHV1 is the first bat-derived alphaherpesvirus whose complete genome has been sequenced.","['1 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Sapporo, Japan.', '2 Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bogor Agricultural University, Bogor, Indonesia.', '3 Veterinary Investigation and Diagnostic Center, Bukittinggi, Indonesia.', '4 Faculty of Agriculture, Gorontalo State University, Gorontalo, Indonesia.', '5 Faculty of Animal Husbandry, Sam Ratulangi University, Manado, Indonesia.', '6 Division of Collaboration and Education, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Sapporo, Japan.', '7 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Sapporo, Japan tkimura@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp.']","Michihito Sasaki, Agus Setiyono, Ekowati Handharyani, Shintaro Kobayashi, Ibenu Rahmadani, Siswatiana Taha, Sri Adiani, Mawar Subangkit, Ichiro Nakamura, Hirofumi Sawa, Takashi Kimura, ",Journal of virology,2014,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24942567
194,Highly diverse morbillivirus-related paramyxoviruses in wild fauna of the southwestern Indian Ocean Islands: evidence of exchange between introduced and endemic small mammals,"The Paramyxoviridae form an increasingly diverse viral family, infecting a wide variety of different hosts. In recent years, they have been linked to disease emergence in many different animal populations and in humans. Bats and rodents have been identified as major animal populations capable of harboring paramyxoviruses, and host shifting between these animals is likely to be an important driving factor in the underlying evolutionary processes that eventually lead to disease emergence. Here, we have studied paramyxovirus circulation within populations of endemic and introduced wild small mammals of the southwestern Indian Ocean region and belonging to four taxonomic orders: Rodentia, Afrosoricida, Soricomorpha, and Chiroptera. We report elevated infection levels as well as widespread paramyxovirus dispersal and frequent host exchange of a newly emerging genus of the Paramyxoviridae, currently referred to as the unclassified morbillivirus-related viruses (UMRVs). In contrast to other genera of the Paramyxoviridae, where bats have been shown to be a key host species, we show that rodents (and, in particular, Rattus rattus) are significant spreaders of UMRVs. We predict that the ecological particularities of the southwestern Indian Ocean, where small mammal species often live in densely packed, multispecies communities, in combination with the increasing invasion of R. rattus and perturbations of endemic animal communities by active anthropological development, will have a major influence on the dynamics of UMRV infection. Importance:
        
      
      Identification of the infectious agents that circulate within wild animal reservoirs is essential for several reasons: (i) infectious disease outbreaks often originate from wild fauna; (ii) anthropological expansion increases the risk of contact between human and animal populations and, as a result, the risk of disease emergence; (iii) evaluation of pathogen reservoirs helps in elaborating preventive measures to limit the risk of disease emergence. Many paramyxoviruses for which bats and rodents serve as major reservoirs have demonstrated their potential to cause disease in humans and animals. In the context of the biodiversity hot spot of southwestern Indian Ocean islands and their rich endemic fauna, we show that highly diverse UMRVs exchange between various endemic animal species, and their dissemination likely is facilitated by the introduced Rattus rattus. Hence, many members of the Paramyxoviridae appear well adapted for the study of the viral phylodynamics that may be associated with disease emergence.","[""1 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Émergentes Dans l'Océan Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, La Réunion, France Université de La Réunion, La Réunion, France dwilkin799@gmail.com herve.pascalis@ird.fr."", ""2 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Émergentes Dans l'Océan Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, La Réunion, France Université de La Réunion, La Réunion, France."", ""3 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Émergentes Dans l'Océan Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, La Réunion, France Association Vahatra, Antananarivo, Madagascar."", '4 Association Vahatra, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', ""5 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Émergentes Dans l'Océan Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, La Réunion, France Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), IRD-BP 50172, La Réunion, France."", '6 Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', '7 UMR_D 190, Aix Marseille University, IRD French Institute of Research for Development, EHESP French School of Public Health, Marseille, France.', '8 Association Vahatra, Antananarivo, Madagascar Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', ""9 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Émergentes Dans l'Océan Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, La Réunion, France Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), IRD-BP 50172, La Réunion, France dwilkin799@gmail.com herve.pascalis@ird.fr.""]","David A Wilkinson, Julien Mélade, Muriel Dietrich, Beza Ramasindrazana, Voahangy Soarimalala, Erwan Lagadec, Gildas le Minter, Pablo Tortosa, Jean-Michel Heraud, Xavier de Lamballerie, Steven M Goodman, Koussay Dellagi, Herve Pascalis, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24829336
195,A metagenomic viral discovery approach identifies potential zoonotic and novel mammalian viruses in Neoromicia bats within South Africa,"Species within the Neoromicia bat genus are abundant and widely distributed in Africa. It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional PCR analysis detected diverse adenovirus and herpesvirus sequences that were widespread throughout Neoromicia populations in South Africa. Furthermore, similar adenovirus sequences were detected within these populations throughout several years. With the exception of the coronaviruses, the study represents the first report of sequence data from several viral families within a Southern African insectivorous bat genus; highlighting the need for continued investigations in this regard.","['1 Centre for Viral Zoonoses, Department of Medical Virology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '2 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Services, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '3 Centre for Microbial Ecology and Genomics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '4 AfricanBats NPC, Pretoria, South Africa.', '5 Eugène Marais Chair of Wildlife Management, Mammal Research Institute, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '6 Ditsong National Museum of Natural History, Pretoria, South Africa.', '7 School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '8 Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States of America.']","Marike Geldenhuys, Marinda Mortlock, Jacqueline Weyer, Oliver Bezuidt, Ernest C J Seamark, Teresa Kearney, Cheryl Gleasner, Tracy H Erkkila, Helen Cui, Wanda Markotter, ",PloS one,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29579103

To investigate the relationships between the genotypes and the significance of genotype I in recent epidemics, we estimated evolutionary rates, ages of common ancestors, and population demographics. Our results indicate that the genotypes diverged in the order IV, III, II, and I and that the genetic diversity of genotype III has decreased rapidly while that of genotype I has increased gradually, consistent with its emergence as the dominant genotype.","['1 Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100052, China.']","Xiao-Ling Pan, Hong Liu, Huan-Yu Wang, Shi-Hong Fu, Hai-Zhou Liu, Hai-Lin Zhang, Ming-Hua Li, Xiao-Yan Gao, Jing-Lin Wang, Xiao-Hong Sun, Xin-Jun Lu, You-Gang Zhai, Wei-Shan Meng, Ying He, Huan-Qin Wang, Na Han, Bo Wei, Yong-Gan Wu, Yun Feng, Du-Juan Yang, Li-Hua Wang, Qin Tang, Guoliang Xia, Ichiro Kurane, Simon Rayner, Guo-Dong Liang, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21697481

Major discoveries include evidence of an origin of Hendra- and Nipah virus in Africa, identification of a bat virus conspecific with the human mumps virus, detection of close relatives of respiratory syncytial virus, mouse pneumonia- and canine distemper virus in bats, as well as direct evidence of Sendai virus in rodents. Phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae). Future attempts to predict the emergence of novel paramyxoviruses in humans and livestock will have to rely fundamentally on these data.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn 53127, Germany.']","Jan Felix Drexler, Victor Max Corman, Marcel Alexander Müller, Gael Darren Maganga, Peter Vallo, Tabea Binger, Florian Gloza-Rausch, Veronika M Cottontail, Andrea Rasche, Stoian Yordanov, Antje Seebens, Mirjam Knörnschild, Samuel Oppong, Yaw Adu Sarkodie, Célestin Pongombo, Alexander N Lukashev, Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, Andreas Stöcker, Aroldo José Borges Carneiro, Stephanie Erbar, Andrea Maisner, Florian Fronhoffs, Reinhard Buettner, Elisabeth K V Kalko, Thomas Kruppa, Carlos Roberto Franke, René Kallies, Emmanuel R N Yandoko, Georg Herrler, Chantal Reusken, Alexandre Hassanin, Detlev H Krüger, Sonja Matthee, Rainer G Ulrich, Eric M Leroy, Christian Drosten, ",Nature communications,2012,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22531181

Urine, spleen, and other organs collected from the R. aegyptiacus population within South Africa were tested with a hemi-nested RT-PCR assay targeting a partial polymerase gene region of viruses from the Avula- and Rubulavirus genera. Urine was collected over a 14-month period to study the temporal dynamics of viral excretion. Diverse rubulaviruses, including viruses related to human mumps and parainfluenza virus 2, were detected. Active excretion was identified during two peak periods coinciding with the host reproductive cycle. Analysis of additional organs indicated co-infection of individual bats with a number of different putative rubulaviruses, highlighting the limitations of using a single sample type when determining viral presence and diversity. Our findings suggest that R. aegyptiacus can harbor a range of Rubula- and related viruses, some of which are related to known human pathogens.

200,"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor divergent viruses, including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses using an alternative genetic code","Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from wildlife and bats are a major reservoir of viruses, a few of which have been highly pathogenic to humans. In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families. Finally, the results of the phage community analyses of these bats indicate a very diverse geographically distinct bat phage population, probably reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems.","['1 Laboratory of Viral Metagenomics.', '2 Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, KU Leuven - University of Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', '3 Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Biotechnology Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Buea, Buea, 237, Cameroon.']","Claude Kwe Yinda, Stephen Mbigha Ghogomu, Nádia Conceição-Neto, Leen Beller, Ward Deboutte, Emiel Vanhulle, Piet Maes, Marc Van Ranst, Jelle Matthijnssens, ",Virus evolution,2018,bastrovirus; bat; metagenomics; picobirnavirus; rotavirus H; virome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29644096
201,Identification of the same polyomavirus species in different African horseshoe bat species is indicative of short-range host-switching events,"Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are considered to be highly host-specific in different mammalian species, with no well-supported evidence for host-switching events. We examined the species diversity and host specificity of PyVs in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.), a broadly distributed and highly speciose mammalian genus. We annotated six PyV genomes, comprising four new PyV species, based on pairwise identity within the large T antigen (LTAg) coding region. Phylogenetic comparisons revealed two instances of highly related PyV species, one in each of the Alphapolyomavirus and Betapolyomavirus genera, present in different horseshoe bat host species (Rhinolophus blasii and R. simulator), suggestive of short-range host-switching events. The two pairs of Rhinolophus PyVs in different horseshoe bat host species were 99.9 and 88.8 % identical with each other over their respective LTAg coding sequences and thus constitute the same virus species. To corroborate the species identification of the bat hosts, we analysed mitochondrial cytb and a large nuclear intron dataset derived from six independent and neutrally evolving loci for bat taxa of interest. Bayesian estimates of the ages of the most recent common ancestors suggested that the near-identical and more distantly related PyV species diverged approximately 9.1E4 (5E3-2.8E5) and 9.9E6 (4E6-18E6) years before the present, respectively, in contrast to the divergence times of the bat host species: 12.4E6 (10.4E6-15.4E6). Our findings provide evidence that short-range host-switching of PyVs is possible in horseshoe bats, suggesting that PyV transmission between closely related mammalian species can occur.","['1 Global Station for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '2 National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', '3 Division of Bioinformatics, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '4 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '5 Zoological Institute and Museum, University of Greifswald, Anklamer Street 20, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.', '6 Hokudai Center for Zoonosis Control in Zambia, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Lusaka, Zambia.', '7 Department of Para-clinical Studies, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.', '8 Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.', '9 School of Biology and Environmental Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', '10 Global Virus Network, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']","Michael Carr, Gabriel Gonzalez, Michihito Sasaki, Serena E Dool, Kimihito Ito, Akihiro Ishii, Bernard M Hang'ombe, Aaron S Mweene, Emma C Teeling, William W Hall, Yasuko Orba, Hirofumi Sawa, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,Africa; Polyomavirus; Rhinolophus; bat; host specificity; host-switching.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28984241

206,Comparison of pathogenic domains of rabies and African rabies-related lyssaviruses and pathogenicity observed in mice,"Several lyssavirus species occur in Africa (Rabies virus, Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus, Duvenhage virus, Shimoni bat virus and Ikoma lyssavirus), displaying a high sequence diversity between isolates belonging to the same species. There is limited information about comparative pathogenesis of these African lyssaviruses and this precludes authoritative opinion on the potential public and veterinary health impact. In this study, an analysis of representative African lyssaviruses attempted to correlate viral genomic sequence similarities and differences with the corresponding pathogenic profiles observed in mice. The study demonstrated that the virus isolates evaluated could be lethal to mice when introduced intramuscularly and that different isolates of the same lyssavirus species differ in their virulence. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral RNA was detected in brain tissue, but no viral RNA was detected in the salivary glands or blood of mice that succumbed to infection. Comparison of known pathogenic domains indicated that pathogenicity is likely to be dependent on multiple domains. Cumulatively, our results re-emphasised the realisation that the pathogenicity of a lyssavirus species cannot be deduced based on studies of only a single isolate of the species or a single pathogenic domain.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, University of Pretoria. wanda.markotter@up.ac.za.']","Joe Kgaladi, Louis H Nel, Wanda Markotter, ",The Onderstepoort journal of veterinary research,2013,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23718883

208,Phylogenetic analysis of a newfound bat-borne hantavirus supports a laurasiatherian host association for ancestral mammalian hantaviruses,"Until recently, hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) were believed to originate from rodent reservoirs. However, genetically distinct hantaviruses were lately found in shrews and moles, as well as in bats from Africa and Asia. Bats (order Chiroptera) are considered important reservoir hosts for emerging human pathogens. Here, we report on the identification of a novel hantavirus, provisionally named Makokou virus (MAKV), in Noack's Roundleaf Bat (Hipposideros ruber) in Gabon, Central Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomic l-segment showed that MAKV was the most closely related to other bat-borne hantaviruses and shared a most recent common ancestor with the Asian hantaviruses Xuan Son and Laibin. Breakdown of the virus load in a bat animal showed that MAKV resembles rodent-borne hantaviruses in its organ distribution in that it predominantly occurred in the spleen and kidney; this provides a first insight into the infection pattern of bat-borne hantaviruses. Ancestral state reconstruction based on a tree of l gene sequences of all relevant hantavirus lineages was combined with phylogenetic fossil host hypothesis testing, leading to a statistically significant rejection of the mammalian superorder Euarchontoglires (including rodents) but not the superorder Laurasiatheria (including shrews, moles, and bats) as potential hosts of ancestral hantaviruses at most basal tree nodes. Our data supports the emerging concept of bats as previously overlooked hantavirus reservoir hosts.","['1 Institute of Virology, Helmut-Ruska-Haus, Charité Medical School, Berlin, Germany.

209,Discovery of diverse polyomaviruses in bats and the evolutionary history of the Polyomaviridae,"Polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been identified in a wide range of avian and mammalian species. However, little is known about their occurrence, genetic diversity and evolutionary history in bats, even though bats are important reservoirs for many emerging viral pathogens. This study screened 380 specimens from 35 bat species from Kenya and Guatemala for the presence of PyVs by semi-nested pan-PyV PCR assays. PyV DNA was detected in 24 of the 380 bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat PyV sequences formed 12 distinct lineages. Full-genome sequences were obtained for seven representative lineages and possessed similar genomic features to known PyVs. Strikingly, this evolutionary analysis revealed that the bat PyVs were paraphyletic, suggestive of multiple species jumps between bats and other mammalian species, such that the theory of virus-host co-divergence for mammalian PyVs as a whole could be rejected. In addition, evidence was found for strong heterogeneity in evolutionary rate and potential recombination in a number of PyV complete genomes, which complicates both phylogenetic analysis and virus classification. In summary, this study revealed that bats are important reservoirs of PyVs and that these viruses have a complex evolutionary history.","['1 Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', '2 Sydney Emerging Infections and Biosecurity Institute, School of Biological Sciences and Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', '3 Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', '4 National Museum, Kenya Wildlife Service, Nairobi, Kenya.', '5 Center for Health Studies, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', '6 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Central America and Panama, Guatemala.', '7 Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', '8 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.']","Ying Tao, Mang Shi, Christina Conrardy, Ivan V Kuzmin, Sergio Recuenco, Bernard Agwanda, Danilo A Alvarez, James A Ellison, Amy T Gilbert, David Moran, Michael Niezgoda, Kim A Lindblade, Edward C Holmes, Robert F Breiman, Charles E Rupprecht, Suxiang Tong, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23239573
210,Genome-scale phylogenetic analyses of chikungunya virus reveal independent emergences of recent epidemics and various evolutionary rates,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus, has traditionally circulated in Africa and Asia, causing human febrile illness accompanied by severe, chronic joint pain. In Africa, epidemic emergence of CHIKV involves the transition from an enzootic, sylvatic cycle involving arboreal mosquito vectors and nonhuman primates, into an urban cycle where peridomestic mosquitoes transmit among humans. In Asia, however, CHIKV appears to circulate only in the endemic, urban cycle. Recently, CHIKV emerged into the Indian Ocean and the Indian subcontinent to cause major epidemics. To examine patterns of CHIKV evolution and the origins of these outbreaks, as well as to examine whether evolutionary rates that vary between enzootic and epidemic transmission, we sequenced the genomes of 40 CHIKV strains and performed a phylogenetic analysis representing the most comprehensive study of its kind to date. We inferred that extant CHIKV strains evolved from an ancestor that existed within the last 500 years and that some geographic overlap exists between two main enzootic lineages previously thought to be geographically separated within Africa. We estimated that CHIKV was introduced from Africa into Asia 70 to 90 years ago. The recent Indian Ocean and Indian subcontinent epidemics appear to have emerged independently from the mainland of East Africa. This finding underscores the importance of surveillance to rapidly detect and control African outbreaks before exportation can occur. Significantly higher rates of nucleotide substitution appear to occur during urban than during enzootic transmission. These results suggest fundamental differences in transmission modes and/or dynamics in these two transmission cycles.","['1 University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Blvd., Galveston, TX 77555-0609. sweaver@utmb.edu.']","Sara M Volk, Rubing Chen, Konstantin A Tsetsarkin, A Paige Adams, Tzintzuni I Garcia, Amadou A Sall, Farooq Nasar, Amy J Schuh, Edward C Holmes, Stephen Higgs, Payal D Maharaj, Aaron C Brault, Scott C Weaver, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20410280

A new lyssavirus, named Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), was isolated from the brain of a dead Commerson's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni), found in a cave in the coastal region of Kenya. Genetic distances and phylogenetic reconstructions, implemented for each gene and for the concatenated alignment of all five structural genes (N, P, M, G and L), demonstrated that SHIBV cannot be identified with any of the existing species, but rather should be considered an independent species within phylogroup II of the Lyssavirus genus, most similar to Lagos bat virus (LBV). Antigenic reaction patterns with anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies corroborated these distinctions. In addition, new data on the diversity of LBV suggests that this species may be subdivided quantitatively into three separate genotypes. However, the identity values alone are not considered sufficient criteria for demarcation of new species within LBV.","['1 Rabies Program, Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. ivkuzmin@yandex.ru']","Ivan V Kuzmin, Anne E Mayer, Michael Niezgoda, Wanda Markotter, Bernard Agwanda, Robert F Breiman, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20138934

We adapted a pseudotype (pt) neutralisation assay (PNA) to a multiplex format enabling serosurveillance for Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) in a potential reservoir, the African straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum. Highly correlated titres were observed between single and multiplex PNAs using ptLBV and ptMOKV (r=0.97, p<0.0001), validating its use for bat serosurveillance. Of the bat serum samples screened 56% neutralised ptLBV, 27% ptMOKV and 1% ptWCBV. Mean VNAb titres were 1:266, 1:35 and 1:7 against ptLBV, ptMOKV and ptWCBV respectively. The high seroprevalence estimates suggest that the infection rate of LBV in E. helvum remains high enough to persist in this species. This supports the hypothesis that LBV is endemic in Ghanaian E. helvum and we speculate that LBV may have co-evolved with African megachiroptera.","['1 Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, 46 Cleveland Street, London, W1T 4JF, UK. edward.wright@ucl.ac.uk']","Edward Wright, David T S Hayman, Aisling Vaughan, Nigel J Temperton, James L N Wood, Andrew A Cunningham, Richard Suu-Ire, Robin A Weiss, Anthony R Fooks, ",Virology,2010,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20951400
216,Lagos bat virus in Kenya,"During lyssavirus surveillance, 1,221 bats of at least 30 species were collected from 25 locations in Kenya. One isolate of Lagos bat virus (LBV) was obtained from a dead Eidolon helvum fruit bat. The virus was most similar phylogenetically to LBV isolates from Senegal (1985) and from France (imported from Togo or Egypt; 1999), sharing with these viruses 100% nucleoprotein identity and 99.8 to 100% glycoprotein identity. This genome conservancy across space and time suggests that LBV is well adapted to its natural host species and that populations of reservoir hosts in eastern and western Africa have sufficient interactions to share pathogens. High virus concentrations, in addition to being detected in the brain, were detected in the salivary glands and tongue and in an oral swab, suggesting that LBV is transmitted in the saliva. In other extraneural organs, the virus was generally associated with innervations and ganglia. The presence of infectious virus in the reproductive tract and in a vaginal swab implies an alternative opportunity for transmission. The isolate was pathogenic for laboratory mice by the intracerebral and intramuscular routes. Serologic screening demonstrated the presence of LBV-neutralizing antibodies in E. helvum and Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats. In different colonies the seroprevalence ranged from 40 to 67% and 29 to 46% for E. helvum and R. aegyptiacus, respectively. Nested reverse transcription-PCR did not reveal the presence of viral RNA in oral swabs of bats in the absence of brain infection. Several large bat roosts were identified in areas of dense human populations, raising public health concerns for the potential of lyssavirus infection.","['1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd., Bldg. 17, MS G-33, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. ikuzmin@cdc.gov']","Ivan V Kuzmin, Michael Niezgoda, Richard Franka, Bernard Agwanda, Wanda Markotter, Janet C Beagley, Olga Y Urazova, Robert F Breiman, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Journal of clinical microbiology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18305130
217,Genomic characterization of seven distinct bat coronaviruses in Kenya,"To better understand the genetic diversity and genomic features of 41 coronaviruses (CoVs) identified from Kenya bats in 2006, seven CoVs as representatives of seven different phylogenetic groups identified from partial polymerase gene sequences, were subjected to extensive genomic sequencing. As a result, 15-16kb nucleotide sequences encoding complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins plus other open reading frames (ORFs) were generated. Sequences analysis confirmed that the CoVs from Kenya bats are divergent members of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. Furthermore, the CoVs BtKY22, BtKY41, and BtKY43 in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY24 in Betacoronavirus genus are likely representatives of 4 novel CoV species. BtKY27 and BtKY33 are members of the established bat CoV species in Alphacoronavirus genus and BtKY06 is a member of the established bat CoV species in Betacoronavirus genus. The genome organization of these seven CoVs is similar to other known CoVs from the same groups except for differences in the number of putative ORFs following the N gene. The present results confirm a significant diversity of CoVs circulating in Kenya bats. These Kenya bat CoVs are phylogenetically distant from any previously described human and animal CoVs. However, because of the examples of host switching among CoVs after relatively minor sequence changes in S1 domain of spike protein, a further surveillance in animal reservoirs and understanding the interface between host susceptibility is critical for predicting and preventing the potential threat of bat CoVs to public health.","['1 Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, United States.']","Ying Tao, Kevin Tang, Mang Shi, Christina Conrardy, Kenneth S M Li, Susanna K P Lau, Larry J Anderson, Suxiang Tong, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22561208

In this study, we report the discovery of PRV in Africa, in an Angolan soft-furred fruit bat (Lissonycteris angolensis ruwenzorii) from Bundibugyo District, Uganda. Metagenomic characterization of a rectal swab yielded 10 dsRNA genome segments, revealing this virus to cluster within the known diversity of PRV variants detected in bats and humans in Southeast Asia. Phylogeographic analyses revealed a correlation between geographic distance and genetic divergence of PRVs globally, which suggests a geographic continuum of PRV diversity spanning Southeast Asia to sub-Saharan Africa.

In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families, in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae), Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin, ecologies and climatic ranges.","['1 Laboratory of Experimental Virology, Department of Medical Microbiology, Center for Infection and Immunity (CINIMA), Academic Medical Centre (AMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","Marta Canuti, Anna Maria Eis-Huebinger, Martin Deijs, Michel de Vries, Jan Felix Drexler, Samuel K Oppong, Marcel A Müller, Stefan M Klose, Nele Wellinghausen, Veronika M Cottontail, Elisabeth K V Kalko, Christian Drosten, Lia van der Hoek, ",PloS one,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22216187

The objective of this surveillance study was to apply a non-invasive approach using fresh feces to detect viruses circulating within the diverse species of Kenyan bats. We screened for both DNA and RNA viruses; specifically, astroviruses (AstVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), caliciviruses (CalVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), flaviviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses (PMVs), polyomaviruses (PYVs) and rotaviruses. We used family-specific primers, amplicon sequencing and further characterization by phylogenetic analysis. Except for filoviruses, eight virus families were detected with varying distributions and positive rates across the five regions (former provinces) studied. AstVs (12.83%), CoVs (3.97%), PMV (2.4%), ADV (2.26%), PYV (1.65%), CalVs (0.29%), rotavirus (0.19%) and flavivirus (0.19%). Novel CalVs were detected in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Mops condylurus while novel Rotavirus-A-related viruses were detected in Taphozous bats and R. aegyptiacus. The two Rotavirus A (RVA) strains detected were highly related to human strains with VP6 genotypes I2 and I16. Genotype I16 has previously been assigned to human RVA-strain B10 from Kenya only, which raises public health concern, particularly considering increased human-bat interaction.

225,Longitudinal Secretion of Paramyxovirus RNA in the Urine of Straw-Coloured Fruit Bats ( Eidolon helvum),"The straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and is widely hunted for bushmeat. It is known to harbour a range of paramyxoviruses, including rubuloviruses and henipaviruses, but the zoonotic potential of these is unknown. We previously found a diversity of paramyxoviruses within a small, captive colony of E. helvum after it had been closed to contact with other bats for 5 years. In this study, we used under-roost urine collection to further investigate the paramyxovirus diversity and ecology in this colony, which had been closed to the outside for 10 years at the time of sampling. By sampling urine weekly throughout an entire year, we investigated possible seasonal patterns of shedding of virus or viral RNA. Using a generic paramyxovirus L-gene PCR, we detected eight distinct paramyxovirus RNA sequences. Six distinct sequences were detected using a Henipavirus-specific PCR that targeted a different region of the L-gene. Sequence detection had a bi-annual pattern, with the greatest peak in July, although different RNA sequences appeared to have different shedding patterns. No significant associations were detected between sequence detection and birthing season, environmental temperature or humidity, and no signs of illness were detected in any of the bats in the colony during the period of sample collection.","['1 Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, London NW1 4RY, UK.', '2 Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Hertfordshire AL9 7TA, UK.', '3 School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Basic and Applied Sciences, University of Ghana, P.O.

228,Longitudinal Survey of Coronavirus Circulation and Diversity in Insectivorous Bat Colonies in Zimbabwe,"Background:
        
      
      Studies have linked bats to outbreaks of viral diseases in human populations such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods:
        
      
      We carried out a longitudinal survey from August 2020 to July 2021 at two sites in Zimbabwe with bat-human interactions: Magweto cave and Chirundu farm. A total of 1732 and 1866 individual bat fecal samples were collected, respectively. Coronaviruses and bat species were amplified using PCR systems. Results:
        
      
      Analysis of the coronavirus sequences revealed a high genetic diversity, and we identified different sub-viral groups in the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genus. The established sub-viral groups fell within the described Alphacoronavirus sub-genera: Decacovirus, Duvinacovirus, Rhinacovirus, Setracovirus and Minunacovirus and for Betacoronavirus sub-genera: Sarbecoviruses, Merbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Our results showed an overall proportion for CoV positive PCR tests of 23.7% at Chirundu site and 16.5% and 38.9% at Magweto site for insectivorous bats and Macronycteris gigas, respectively. Conclusions:
        
      
      The higher risk of bat coronavirus exposure for humans was found in December to March in relation to higher viral shedding peaks of coronaviruses in the parturition, lactation and weaning months of the bat populations at both sites. We also highlight the need to further document viral infectious risk in human/domestic animal populations surrounding bat habitats in Zimbabwe.","['1 Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Zimbabwe, Harare P.O.

231,Lyssavirus matrix protein induces apoptosis by a TRAIL-dependent mechanism involving caspase-8 activation,"Lyssaviruses, which are members of the Rhabdoviridae family, induce apoptosis, which plays an important role in the neuropathogenesis of rabies. However, the mechanisms by which these viruses mediate neuronal apoptosis have not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate that the early induction of apoptosis in a model of lyssavirus-infected neuroblastoma cells involves a TRAIL-dependent pathway requiring the activation of caspase-8 but not of caspase-9 or caspase-10. The activation of caspase-8 results in the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-6, as shown by an increase in the cleavage of the specific caspase substrate in lyssavirus-infected cells. However, neither caspase-1 nor caspase-2 activity was detected during the early phase of infection. Lyssavirus-mediated cell death involves an interaction between TRAIL receptors and TRAIL, as demonstrated by experiments using neutralizing antibodies and soluble decoy TRAIL-R1/R2 receptors. We also demonstrated that the decapsidation and replication of lyssavirus are essential for inducing apoptosis, as supported by UV inactivation, cycloheximide treatment, and the use of bafilomycin A1 to inhibit endosomal acidification. Transfection of cells with the matrix protein induced apoptosis using pathways similar to those described in the context of viral infection. Furthermore, our data suggest that the matrix protein of lyssaviruses plays a major role in the early induction of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by the release of a soluble, active form of TRAIL. In our model, Fas ligand (CD95L) appears to play a limited role in lyssavirus-mediated neuroblastoma cell death. Similarly, tumor necrosis factor alpha does not appear to play an important role.","['1 Laboratoire de la Rage, Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Docteur Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']","Raïd Kassis, Florence Larrous, Jérôme Estaquier, Hervé Bourhy, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15163747

The likely source of infection in the cave was Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) based on detection of Marburg virus RNA in 31/611 (5.1%) bats, virus-specific antibody in bat sera, and isolation of genetically diverse virus from bat tissues. The virus isolates were collected nine months apart, demonstrating long-term virus circulation. The bat colony was estimated to be over 100,000 animals using mark and re-capture methods, predicting the presence of over 5,000 virus-infected bats. The genetically diverse virus genome sequences from bats and miners closely matched.

237,Persistence of Multiple Paramyxoviruses in a Closed Captive Colony of Fruit Bats ( Eidolon helvum),"Bats have been identified as the natural hosts of several emerging zoonotic viruses, including paramyxoviruses, such as Hendra and Nipah viruses, that can cause fatal disease in humans. Recently, African fruit bats with populations that roost in or near urban areas have been shown to harbour a great diversity of paramyxoviruses, posing potential spillover risks to public health. Understanding the circulation of these viruses in their reservoir populations is essential to predict and prevent future emerging diseases. Here, we identify a high incidence of multiple paramyxoviruses in urine samples collected from a closed captive colony of circa 115 straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum). The sequences detected have high nucleotide identities with those derived from free ranging African fruit bats and form phylogenetic clusters with the Henipavirus genus, Pararubulavirus genus and other unclassified paramyxoviruses. As this colony had been closed for 5 years prior to this study, these results indicate that within-host paramyxoviral persistence underlies the role of bats as reservoirs of these viruses.","[""1 Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY, UK."", '2 Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Royal College Street, London NW1 0TU, UK.', '3 Disease Dynamics Unit, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0ES, UK.', '4 School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Basic and Applied Sciences, University of Ghana, Legon, Accra P.O.

239,Interferon regulatory factor 5-dependent immune responses in the draining lymph node protect against West Nile virus infection,"Upon activation of Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways, the transcription factor IRF5 translocates to the nucleus and induces antiviral immune programs. The recent discovery of a homozygous mutation in the immunoregulatory gene guanine exchange factor dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (Dock2mu/mu) in several Irf5-/- mouse colonies has complicated interpretation of immune functions previously ascribed to IRF5. To define the antiviral functions of IRF5 in vivo, we infected backcrossed Irf5-/-×Dock2wt/wt mice (here called Irf5-/- mice) and independently generated CMV-Cre Irf5fl/fl mice with West Nile virus (WNV), a pathogenic neurotropic flavivirus. Compared to congenic wild-type animals, Irf5-/- and CMV-Cre Irf5fl/fl mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection, and this phenotype was associated with increased infection in peripheral organs, which resulted in higher virus titers in the central nervous system. The loss of IRF5, however, was associated with only small differences in the type I interferon response systemically and in the draining lymph node during WNV infection. Instead, lower levels of several other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as fewer and less activated immune cells, were detected in the draining lymph node 2 days after WNV infection. WNV-specific antibody responses in Irf5-/- mice also were blunted in the context of live or inactivated virus infection and this was associated with fewer antigen-specific memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Our results with Irf5-/- mice establish a key role for IRF5 in shaping the early innate immune response in the draining lymph node, which impacts the spread of virus infection, optimal B cell immunity, and disease pathogenesis. Importance:
        
      
      Although the roles of IRF3 and IRF7 in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity after viral infection are established, the function of the related transcription factor IRF5 remains less certain. Prior studies in Irf5-/- mice reported conflicting results as to the contribution of IRF5 in regulating type I interferon and adaptive immune responses. The lack of clarity may stem from a recently discovered homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the immunoregulatory gene Dock2 in several colonies of Irf5-/- mice. Here, using a mouse model with a deficiency in IRF5 and wild-type Dock2 alleles, we investigated how IRF5 modulates West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis and host immune responses. Our in vivo studies indicate that IRF5 has a key role in shaping the early proinflammatory cytokine response in the draining lymph node, which impacts immunity and control of WNV infection.","['1 Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', '2 Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA.', '3 Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA The Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA diamond@borcim.wustl.edu.']","Larissa B Thackray, Bimmi Shrestha, Justin M Richner, Jonathan J Miner, Amelia K Pinto, Helen M Lazear, Michael Gale Jr, Michael S Diamond, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25031348
240,Seasonal pulses of Marburg virus circulation in juvenile Rousettus aegyptiacus bats coincide with periods of increased risk of human infection,"Marburg virus (family Filoviridae) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Bats have been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in 2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40,000 R. aegyptiacus were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present. Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1,622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated ~2.5% of the bats were actively infected, seven of which yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for R. aegyptiacus tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (~six months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83% (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of two tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with R. aegyptiacus bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges. These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg hemorrhagic fever risk reduction strategies.","['1 Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']","Brian R Amman, Serena A Carroll, Zachary D Reed, Tara K Sealy, Stephen Balinandi, Robert Swanepoel, Alan Kemp, Bobbie Rae Erickson, James A Comer, Shelley Campbell, Deborah L Cannon, Marina L Khristova, Patrick Atimnedi, Christopher D Paddock, Rebekah J Kent Crockett, Timothy D Flietstra, Kelly L Warfield, Robert Unfer, Edward Katongole-Mbidde, Robert Downing, Jordan W Tappero, Sherif R Zaki, Pierre E Rollin, Thomas G Ksiazek, Stuart T Nichol, Jonathan S Towner, ",PLoS pathogens,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23055920

Replication kinetics were assessed for Bukakata orbivirus in three different vertebrate cell lines. Lastly, qRT-PCR and nested PCR were used to determine the prevalence of Bukakata orbivirus RNA in archived samples from three populations of Egyptian fruit bats and one population of cave-associated soft ticks in Uganda. Complete coding sequences were obtained for all ten segments of Fomede, Ife, and Japanaut orbiviruses and for nine of the ten segments for Bukakata orbivirus. Phylogenetic analysis placed Bukakata and Fomede in the tick-borne orbivirus clade and Ife and Japanaut within the Culicoides/phlebotomine sandfly orbivirus clade. Further, Bukakata and Fomede appear to be serotypes of the Chobar Gorge virus species. Bukakata orbivirus replicated to high titers (10⁶⁻10⁷ PFU/mL) in Vero, BHK-21 [C-13], and R06E (Egyptian fruit bat) cells. Preliminary screening of archived bat and tick samples do not support Bukakata orbivirus presence in these collections, however additional testing is warranted given the phylogenetic associations observed. This study provided complete coding sequence for several bat-associated orbiviruses and in vitro characterization of a bat-associated orbivirus. Our results indicate that bats may play an important role in the epidemiology of viruses in the genus Orbivirus and further investigation is warranted into vector-host associations and ongoing surveillance efforts.","['1 Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. anna.fagre@colostate.edu.', '2 Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. justin.lee@colostate.edu.', '3 Department of Zoology, Entomology and Fisheries Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. kityrob@gmail.com.', '4 Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. nicholas.bergren@colostate.edu.', '5 Arboviral Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. ilv8@cdc.gov.', '6 Department of Arbovirology, Emerging, and Re-emerging Viral Infections, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda. nakayikiteddie@yahoo.com.', '7 Department of Zoology, Entomology and Fisheries Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. bnalikka@gmail.com.', '8 Department of Arbovirology, Emerging, and Re-emerging Viral Infections, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe, Uganda. nyakarahuka@gmail.com.', '9 Department of Biosecurity, Ecosystems and Veterinary Public Health, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. nyakarahuka@gmail.com.', '10 National Wildlife Research Center, US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services, Fort Collins, CO 80521, USA.

242,Characterization of a Novel Bat Adenovirus Isolated from Straw-Colored Fruit Bat (Eidolon helvum),"Bats are important reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses. For extensive surveys of potential pathogens in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Zambia, a total of 107 spleen samples of E. helvum in 2006 were inoculated onto Vero E6 cells. The cell culture inoculated with one of the samples (ZFB06-106) exhibited remarkable cytopathic changes. Based on the ultrastructural property in negative staining and cross-reactivity in immunofluorescence assays, the virus was suspected to be an adenovirus, and tentatively named E. helvum adenovirus 06-106 (EhAdV 06-106). Analysis of the full-length genome of 30,134 bp, determined by next-generation sequencing, showed the presence of 28 open reading frames. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that EhAdV 06-106 represented a novel bat adenovirus species in the genus Mastadenovirus. The virus shared similar characteristics of low G + C contents with recently isolated members of species Bat mastadenoviruses E, F and G, from which EhAdV 06-106 diverged by more than 15% based on the distance matrix analysis of DNA polymerase amino acid sequences. According to the taxonomic criteria, we propose the tentative new species name ""Bat mastadenovirus H"". Because EhAdV 06-106 exhibited a wide in vitro cell tropism, the virus might have a potential risk as an emerging virus through cross-species transmission.","['1 Department of Virology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, Japan. hogawa@okayama-u.ac.jp.', '2 Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, P.O.

243,Co-circulation of diverse paramyxoviruses in an urban African fruit bat population,"Bats constitute a reservoir of zoonotic infections and some bat paramyxoviruses are capable of cross-species transmission, often with fatal consequences. Determining the level of viral diversity in reservoir populations is fundamental to understanding and predicting viral emergence. This is particularly relevant for RNA viruses where the adaptive mutations required for cross-species transmission can be present in the reservoir host. We report the use of non-invasively collected, pooled, neat urine samples as a robust sample type for investigating paramyxoviruses in bat populations. Using consensus PCR assays we have detected a high incidence and genetic diversity of novel paramyxoviruses in an urban fruit bat population over a short period of time. This may suggest a similarly unique relationship between bats and the members of the family Paramyxoviridae as proposed for some other viral families. Additionally, the high rate of bat-human contact at the study site calls for the zoonotic potential of the detected viruses to be investigated further.","['1 Cambridge Infectious Diseases Consortium, University of Cambridge, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0ES, UK.', ""2 Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY, UK."", '3 CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratories, Portarlington Road, East Geelong, VIC 3219, Australia.', '4 Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission, Accra, Ghana.', '5 University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.']","K S Baker, S Todd, G Marsh, A Fernandez-Loras, R Suu-Ire, J L N Wood, L F Wang, P R Murcia, A A Cunningham, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22205718

Emerging viruses such as SARS coronavirus, hantaviruses and henipaviruses have wildlife reservoirs. Characterising the viruses of candidate reservoir species in geographical hot spots for viral emergence is a sensible approach to develop tools to predict, prevent, or contain emergence events. Here, we explore the viruses of Eidolon helvum, an Old World fruit bat species widely distributed in Africa that lives in close proximity to humans. We identified a great abundance and diversity of novel herpes and papillomaviruses, described the isolation of a novel adenovirus, and detected, for the first time, sequences of a chiropteran poxvirus closely related with Molluscum contagiosum. In sum, E. helvum display a wide variety of mammalian viruses, some of them genetically similar to known human pathogens, highlighting the possibility of zoonotic transmission.","['1 University of Cambridge, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Madingley Rd, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB3 0ES, United Kingdom. kf281@cam.ac.uk']","Kate S Baker, Richard M Leggett, Nicholas H Bexfield, Mark Alston, Gordon Daly, Shawn Todd, Mary Tachedjian, Clare E G Holmes, Sandra Crameri, Lin-Fa Wang, Jonathan L Heeney, Richard Suu-Ire, Paul Kellam, Andrew A Cunningham, James L N Wood, Mario Caccamo, Pablo R Murcia, ",Virology,2013,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23562481

This species has been identified as a reservoir of potentially zoonotic viruses, but uncertainties remain regarding viral transmission dynamics and mechanisms of persistence. Here we combine genetic and serological analyses of populations across Africa, to determine the extent of epidemiological connectivity among E. helvum populations. Multiple markers reveal panmixia across the continental range, at a greater geographical scale than previously recorded for any other mammal, whereas populations on remote islands were genetically distinct. Multiple serological assays reveal antibodies to henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus in all locations, including small isolated island populations, indicating that factors other than population size and connectivity may be responsible for viral persistence. Our findings have potentially important public health implications, and highlight a need to avoid disturbances that may precipitate viral spillover.","['1 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0ES, UK.', ""2 Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London, NW1 4RY, UK."", '3 Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, A1301, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, CB101SA, UK.', '4 Wildlife Zoonoses and Vector-Borne Diseases Research Group, Department of Virology, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey, KT15 3NB, UK.', '5 Department of Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, CO 80523, USA.', '6 Department of Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.', '7 CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, 3220, Australia.', '8 Wildlife Division, Ghana Forestry Commission, Accra, Ghana.', '9 University of Ghana, Faculty of Animal Biology and Conservation Science, Box LG 571, Legon, Accra, Ghana.', '10 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814-4799, USA.', '11 Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, U.K.', '12 Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore 169857.', '13 University of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, Liverpool, L3 5TQ, UK.', '14 School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, London, E1 4NS, UK.']","Alison J Peel, David R Sargan, Kate S Baker, David T S Hayman, Jennifer A Barr, Gary Crameri, Richard Suu-Ire, Christopher C Broder, Tiziana Lembo, Lin-Fa Wang, Anthony R Fooks, Stephen J Rossiter, James L N Wood, Andrew A Cunningham, ",Nature communications,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24253424
246,A nairovirus isolated from African bats causes haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and severe hepatic disease in mice,"Bats can carry important zoonotic pathogens. Here we use a combination of next-generation sequencing and classical virus isolation methods to identify novel nairoviruses from bats captured from a cave in Zambia. This nairovirus infection is highly prevalent among giant leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros gigas (detected in samples from 16 individuals out of 38). Whole-genome analysis of three viral isolates (11SB17, 11SB19 and 11SB23) reveals a typical bunyavirus tri-segmented genome. The strains form a single phylogenetic clade that is divergent from other known nairoviruses, and are hereafter designated as Leopards Hill virus (LPHV). When i.p. injected into mice, the 11SB17 strain causes only slight body weight loss, whereas 11SB23 produces acute and lethal disease closely resembling that observed with Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus in humans. We believe that our LPHV mouse model will be useful for research on the pathogenesis of nairoviral haemorrhagic disease.","['1 1] Hokudai Center for Zoonosis Control in Zambia, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan [2] Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Great East Road, PO Box 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia.', '2 Division of Bioinformatics, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '3 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '4 Department of Para-clinical studies, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Great East Road, PO Box 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia.', '5 Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Great East Road, PO Box 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia.', '6 Department of Comparative Pathology, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '7 1] Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland [2] Global Virus Network, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA [3] Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '8 1] Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Great East Road, PO Box 32379, Lusaka 10101, Zambia [2] Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan [3] Global Virus Network, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA [4] Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.']","Akihiro Ishii, Keisuke Ueno, Yasuko Orba, Michihito Sasaki, Ladslav Moonga, Bernard M Hang'ombe, Aaron S Mweene, Takashi Umemura, Kimihito Ito, William W Hall, Hirofumi Sawa, ",Nature communications,2014,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451856
247,"A novel rhabdovirus isolated from the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum, with signs of antibodies in swine and humans","Bats have been implicated as reservoirs of emerging viruses. Bat species forming large social groups and roosting in proximity to human communities are of particular interest. In this study, we sampled a colony of ca. 350,000 individuals of the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum in Kumasi, the second largest city of Ghana. A novel rhabdovirus (Kumasi rhabdovirus [KRV]) was isolated in E. helvum cell cultures and passaged to Vero cells as well as interferon-competent human and primate cells (A549 and MA104). Genome composition was typical for a rhabdovirus. KRV was detected in 5.1% of 487 animals, showing association with the spleen but not the brain. Antibody prevalence was 11.5% by immunofluorescence and 6.4% by plaque reduction virus neutralization test (PRNT). Detection throughout 3 sampling years was pronounced in both annual wet seasons, of which only one overlaps the postparturition season. Juvenile bats showed increased viral prevalence. No evidence of infection was obtained in 1,240 female mosquitos (6 different genera) trapped in proximity to the colony to investigate potential vector association. Antibodies were found in 28.9% (5.4% by PRNT) of 107 swine sera but not in similarly large collections of sheep, goat, or cattle sera. The antibody detection rate in human subjects with occupational exposure to the bat colony was 11% (5/45 persons), which was significantly higher than in unexposed adults (0.8% [1/118]; chi square, P < 0.001). KRV is a novel bat-associated rhabdovirus potentially transmitted to humans and swine. Disease associations should be investigated. Importance:
        
      
      Bats are thought to carry a huge number of as-yet-undiscovered viruses that may pose epidemic threats to humans and livestock. Here we describe a novel dimarhabdovirus which we isolated from a large colony of the straw-colored fruit bat Eidolon helvum in Ghana. As these animals are exposed to humans and several livestock species, we looked for antibodies indicating infection in humans, cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. Signs of infection were found in swine and humans, with increased antibody findings in humans who are occupationally exposed to the bat colony. Our data suggest that it is worthwhile to look for diseases caused by the novel virus in humans and livestock.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany.', '2 Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine (KCCR), Kumasi, Ghana.', '3 Ghana Veterinary Service, Kumasi, Ghana.', '4 Kumasi Zoo Wildlife Division, Forestry Commission, Kumasi, Ghana.', '5 Bernhard Nocht Institute, Hamburg, Germany Clinic for Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.', '6 Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', '7 Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.', '8 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), Bonn/Cologne, Germany drosten@virology-bonn.de.']","Tabea Binger, Augustina Annan, Jan Felix Drexler, Marcel Alexander Müller, René Kallies, Ernest Adankwah, Robert Wollny, Anne Kopp, Hanna Heidemann, Dickson Dei, Festus Courage Agya-Yao, Sandra Junglen, Torsten Feldt, Andreas Kurth, Samuel Oppong, Yaw Adu-Sarkodie, Christian Drosten, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25673701

Most MVD outbreaks originated in East Africa and field studies in East Africa, South Africa, Zambia, and Gabon identified the Egyptian rousette bat (ERB; Rousettus aegyptiacus) as a natural reservoir. However, the largest recorded MVD outbreak with the highest case-fatality ratio happened in 2005 in Angola, where direct spillover from bats was not shown. Here, collaborative studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Njala University, University of California, Davis USAID-PREDICT, and the University of Makeni identify MARV circulating in ERBs in Sierra Leone. PCR, antibody and virus isolation data from 1755 bats of 42 species shows active MARV infection in approximately 2.5% of ERBs. Phylogenetic analysis identifies MARVs that are similar to the Angola strain. These results provide evidence of MARV circulation in West Africa and demonstrate the value of pathogen surveillance to identify previously undetected threats.","['1 Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd.

249,Bat coronavirus phylogeography in the Western Indian Ocean,"Bats provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal, and soil fertilization. Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% ± 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% ± 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of α- and β-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites. These results highlight that strong variation between islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each island. Future studies should investigate whether CoVs detected in these bats have a potential for spillover in other hosts.","['1 Université de La Réunion, UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical (PIMIT), INSERM 1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249, Sainte-Clotilde, La Réunion, France. lea.joffrin@gmail.com.', '2 Association Vahatra, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', '3 Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, USA.', '4 Université de La Réunion, UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical (PIMIT), INSERM 1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249, Sainte-Clotilde, La Réunion, France.', '5 Beza Ramasindrazana, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, BP 1274, Ambatofotsikely, Antananarivo, 101, Madagascar.', '6 Veterinary Faculty, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.', '7 School of Life Sciences, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa.', '8 National Parks and Conservation Service, Réduit, Mauritius.', '9 Seychelles Ministry of Health, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.', '10 Instituto Nacional de Saúde, Maputo, Mozambique.', '11 Université de La Réunion, UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical (PIMIT), INSERM 1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249, Sainte-Clotilde, La Réunion, France. camille.lebarbenchon@univ-reunion.fr.']","Léa Joffrin, Steven M Goodman, David A Wilkinson, Beza Ramasindrazana, Erwan Lagadec, Yann Gomard, Gildas Le Minter, Andréa Dos Santos, M Corrie Schoeman, Rajendraprasad Sookhareea, Pablo Tortosa, Simon Julienne, Eduardo S Gudo, Patrick Mavingui, Camille Lebarbenchon, ",Scientific reports,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327721

Here we report the formation of bilayer ordering in PCDTBT, and postulate that this structural motif is a direct consequence of the polymer's molecular design. This bilayer motif is composed of a pair of backbones arranged side-to-side where the alkyl tails are on the outer side. This is in stark contrast to the monolayer ordering found in other conjugated polymers. The crystalline bilayer phase forms at elevated temperatures and persists after cooling to room temperature. The existence of bilayer ordering, along with its high-packing fraction of conjugated moieties, may guide the synthesis of new materials with improved optoelectronic properties.","['1 Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York 11973, USA.']","Xinhui Lu, Htay Hlaing, David S Germack, Jeff Peet, Won Ho Jo, Denis Andrienko, Kurt Kremer, Benjamin M Ocko, ",Nature communications,2012,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22531180

Bats also harbour group A rotaviruses, but the genetic backgrounds of bat rotavirus strains are usually distinct from those of human rotavirus strains. We identified a new strain of group A rotavirus in the intestinal contents of a horseshoe bat in Zambia. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the identified virus, named RVA/Bat-wt/ZMB/LUS12-14/2012/G3P[3], possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I3-R2-C2-M3-A9-N2-T3-E2-H3. Several genome segments of LUS12-14 were highly similar to those of group A rotaviruses identified from humans, cows and antelopes, indicating interspecies transmission of rotaviruses between bats and other mammals with possible multiple genomic reassortment events.","['1 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '2 Division of Bioinformatics, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '3 Hokudai Center for Zoonosis Control in Zambia, PO Box 32379, Lusaka, Zambia.', '4 Department of Paraclinical Studies, School of Veterinary and Medicine, University of Zambia, PO Box 32379, Lusaka, Zambia.', '5 Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary and Medicine, University of Zambia, PO Box 32379, Lusaka, Zambia.', '6 Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '7 Global Virus Network, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']","Michihito Sasaki, Yasuko Orba, Satoko Sasaki, Gabriel Gonzalez, Akihiro Ishii, Bernard M Hang'ombe, Aaron S Mweene, Kimihito Ito, Hirofumi Sawa, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27574104
252,Discovery of African bat polyomaviruses and infrequent recombination in the large T antigen in the Polyomaviridae,"Bat species represent natural reservoirs for a number of high-consequence human pathogens. The present study investigated the diversity of polyomaviruses (PyVs) in Zambian insectivorous and fruit bat species. We describe the complete genomes from four newly proposed African bat PyV species employing the recently recommended criteria provided by the Polyomaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. A comprehensive phylogenetic and recombination analysis was performed to determine genetic relationships and the distribution of recombination events in PyV from mammalian and avian species. The novel species of PyV from Zambian bats segregated with members of the genera Alphapolyomavirus and Betapolyomavirus, forming monophyletic clades with bat and non-human primate PyVs. Miniopterus schreibersii polyomavirus 1 and 2 segregated in a clade with South American bat PyV species, Old World monkey and chimpanzee PyVs and Human polyomavirus 13 (New Jersey PyV). Interestingly, the newly described Egyptian fruit bat PyV, tentatively named Rousettus aegyptiacus polyomavirus 1, had the highest nucleotide sequence identity to species of PyV from Indonesian fruit bats, and Rhinolophus hildebrandtii polyomavirus 1 was most closely related to New World monkey PyVs. The distribution of recombination events in PyV genomes was non-random: recombination boundaries existed in the intergene region between VP1 and LTAg and also at the 3' end of VP2/3 in the structural genes, whereas infrequent recombination was present within the LTAg gene. These findings indicate that recombination within the LTAg gene has been negatively selected against during polyomaviral evolution and support the recent proposal for taxonomic classification based on LTAg to define novel PyV species.","['1 Global Station for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '2 National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.', '3 Division of Bioinformatics, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '4 Division of Molecular Pathobiology, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, N20, W10, Kita-ku, Sapporo 001-0020, Japan.', '5 Hokudai Center for Zoonosis Control in Zambia, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Lusaka, Zambia.', '6 Department of Para-clinical Studies, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.', '7 Department of Disease Control, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.', '8 Global Virus Network, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']","Michael Carr, Gabriel Gonzalez, Michihito Sasaki, Kimihito Ito, Akihiro Ishii, Bernard M Hang'ombe, Aaron S Mweene, Yasuko Orba, Hirofumi Sawa, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28430100
253,Detection of new genetic variants of Betacoronaviruses in Endemic Frugivorous Bats of Madagascar,"Background:
        
      
      Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. Methods:
        
      
      Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens. Results:
        
      
      From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. Conclusions:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.","['1 Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, Ambatofotsikely, BP 1274, Antananarivo, Madagascar, Dummy_Only. norosoa@pasteur.mg.', '2 Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, Ambatofotsikely, BP 1274, Antananarivo, Madagascar, Dummy_Only. lalaina@pasteur.mg.', ""3 Centre de Recherche et de Veille sur les Maladies Emergentes dans l'Ocean Indien (CRVOI), Plateforme de Recherche CYROI, 2 rue Maxime Riviere, 97490, Sainte Clotilde, La Reunion, France. dwilkin799@gmail.com."", '4 Madagasikara Voakajy, BP 5181, Antananarivo, Madagascar. hantajulie@gmail.com.', '5 Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Antananarivo, BP 906, Antananarivo, Madagascar. hantajulie@gmail.com.', '6 Association Vahatra, BP 3972, Antananarivo, Madagascar. sgoodman@fieldmuseum.org.', '7 School of Environment, Natural Resources and Geography, Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, United Kingdom. rkbjenkins@gmail.com.', '8 School of Environment, Natural Resources and Geography, Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, United Kingdom. julia.jones@bangor.ac.uk.', '9 Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, Ambatofotsikely, BP 1274, Antananarivo, Madagascar, Dummy_Only. jmheraud@pasteur.mg.']","Norosoa H Razanajatovo, Lalaina A Nomenjanahary, David A Wilkinson, Julie H Razafimanahaka, Steven M Goodman, Richard K Jenkins, Julia P G Jones, Jean-Michel Heraud, ",Virology journal,2015,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25888853

257,Bat Astrovirus in Mozambique,"Astroviruses (AstVs) are responsible for infection of a large diversity of mammalian and avian species, including bats, aquatic birds, livestock and humans. We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte, a small island in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats (Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus) tested positive; however, 20.1% of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages, while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association, but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands, including the southeastern African coast, and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.","['1 Université de La Réunion, UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical (PIMIT), INSERM 1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249, 2 rue Maxime Rivière (GIP CYROI), 97490 Sainte-Clotilde, La Réunion, France.', '2 School of Life Sciences, Biological Sciences Building, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Ring Road, Westville Campus, Kwa-Zulu Natal, 3630, South Africa.', '3 Association Vahatra, BP 3972, 101, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', '4 Present Address: Institut Pasteur de Madagascar,Ambatofotsikely, 101, Antananarivo, Madagascar.', '5 Veterinary Faculty, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique.', '6 Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, 60605, USA.', '7 Instituto Nacional de Saúde, Maputo, Mozambique.', '8 Université de La Réunion, UMR Processus Infectieux en Milieu Insulaire Tropical (PIMIT), INSERM 1187, CNRS 9192, IRD 249, 2 rue Maxime Rivière (GIP CYROI), 97490 Sainte-Clotilde, La Réunion, France. camille.lebarbenchon@univ-reunion.fr.']","Flora Hoarau, Gildas Le Minter, Léa Joffrin, M Corrie Schoeman, Erwan Lagadec, Beza Ramasindrazana, Andréa Dos Santos, Steven M Goodman, Eduardo S Gudo, Patrick Mavingui, Camille Lebarbenchon, ",Virology journal,2018,Madagascar; Mammastrovirus; Mayotte; Mozambique; Triaenops afer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29925396
258,Experimental rabies virus infection of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus),"A captive colony of adult Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus) was experimentally infected with a rabies virus (RABV) variant isolated from the salivary glands of a naturally infected Big Brown Bat and passaged once through murine neuroblastoma cell culture. Bats were divided into 11 groups, which were composed of one to three noninfected and one to three infected individuals each. Twenty of 38 animals were infected intramuscularly into both left and right masseter muscles; they received a total of 10(3.2) median mouse intracerebral lethal dose (MICLD50) of Big Brown Bat RABV variant. Experimental outcome after viral exposure was followed in the bats for 140 days postinoculation (PI). Of 20 infected bats, 16 developed clinical rabies, and the mean incubation period was 24 days (range: 13-52 days). Three infected bats never seroconverted and succumbed early to infection (13 days). Four infected bats that survived until the end of the experiment without any signs of disease maintained detectable antibody titers until the third month PI, peaking between days 13 and 43, and consequent drop-off below the threshold for detection occurred by day 140. Limited excretion of virus in saliva of infected bats during the clinical course of disease was observed in two individuals on days 13 and 15 PI (<24 hr prior to onset of clinical illness). No bat-to-bat transmission of RABV to noninfected bats was detected.","['1 Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.']","Felix R Jackson, Amy S Turmelle, David M Farino, Richard Franka, Gary F McCracken, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Journal of wildlife diseases,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18689646

To investigate this possibility, archival tissues from 213 insectivorous bats (order Chiroptera) were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Following numerous failed attempts, hantavirus RNA was detected in ethanol-fixed liver tissue from two banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus), captured near Mouyassué village in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, in June 2011. Phylogenetic analysis of partial L-segment sequences using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed that the newfound hantavirus, designated Mouyassué virus (MOUV), was highly divergent and basal to all other rodent- and soricomorph-borne hantaviruses, except for Nova virus in the European common mole (Talpa europaea). Full genome sequencing of MOUV and further surveys of other bat species for hantaviruses, now underway, will provide critical insights into the evolution and diversification of hantaviruses.","['1 Department of Pediatrics and Tropical Medicine, John A.

260,Spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies virus variants in big brown bat populations across Canada: footprints of an emerging zoonosis,"Phylogenetic analysis of a collection of rabies viruses that currently circulate in Canadian big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) identified five distinct lineages which have emerged from a common ancestor that existed over 400 years ago. Four of these lineages are regionally restricted in their range while the fifth lineage, comprising two-thirds of all specimens, has emerged in recent times and exhibits a recent demographic expansion with rapid spread across the Canadian range of its host. Four of these viral lineages are shown to circulate in the US. To explore the role of the big brown bat host in dissemination of these viral variants, the population structure of this species was explored using both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite markers. These data suggest the existence of three subpopulations distributed in British Columbia, mid-western Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario), respectively. We suggest that these three bat subpopulations may differ by their level of female phylopatry, which in turn affects the spread of rabies viruses. We discuss how this bat population structure has affected the historical spread of rabies virus variants across the country and the potential impact of these events on public health concerns regarding rabies.","['1 Centre of Expertise for Rabies, Ottawa Laboratory (Fallowfield), Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. susan.nadin-davis@inspection.gc.ca']","Susan A Nadin-Davis, Yuqin Feng, Delphine Mousse, Alexander I Wandeler, Stéphane Aris-Brosou, ",Molecular ecology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20406385

We hypothesized that prior infection with ZIKV could be confirmed through the presence of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) of the 3' untranslated region (UTR), which persists in tissues due to XRN-1 stalling during RNA decay. We amplified ZIKV sfRNA but not NS5 from three experimentally-infected Jamaican fruit bats, supporting the hypothesis of sfRNA tissue persistence. Applying this approach to 198 field samples from Uganda, we confirmed presence of ZIKV sfRNA, but not NS5, in four bats representing three species: Eidolon helvum (n = 2), Epomophorus labiatus (n = 1), and Rousettus aegyptiacus (n = 1).

265,Bat guano virome: predominance of dietary viruses from insects and plants plus novel mammalian viruses,"Bats are hosts to a variety of viruses capable of zoonotic transmissions. Because of increased contact between bats, humans, and other animal species, the possibility exists for further cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. We describe here full and partial viral genomes identified using metagenomics in the guano of bats from California and Texas. A total of 34% and 58% of 390,000 sequence reads from bat guano in California and Texas, respectively, were related to eukaryotic viruses, and the largest proportion of those infect insects, reflecting the diet of these insectivorous bats, including members of the viral families Dicistroviridae, Iflaviridae, Tetraviridae, and Nodaviridae and the subfamily Densovirinae. The second largest proportion of virus-related sequences infects plants and fungi, likely reflecting the diet of ingested insects, including members of the viral families Luteoviridae, Secoviridae, Tymoviridae, and Partitiviridae and the genus Sobemovirus. Bat guano viruses related to those infecting mammals comprised the third largest group, including members of the viral families Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Astroviridae, and Coronaviridae. No close relative of known human viral pathogens was identified in these bat populations. Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families. Viral metagenomics is a useful tool for genetically characterizing viruses present in animals with the known capability of direct or indirect viral zoonosis to humans.","['1 Blood Systems Research Institute. 270 Masonic Ave., San Francisco, CA 94118, USA.']","Linlin Li, Joseph G Victoria, Chunlin Wang, Morris Jones, Gary M Fellers, Thomas H Kunz, Eric Delwart, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20463061
266,Lyssavirus P gene characterisation provides insights into the phylogeny of the genus and identifies structural similarities and diversity within the encoded phosphoprotein,"A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Lyssavirus genus, employing P gene sequences from 128 isolates recovered globally, is presented. While confirming prior suggestions of the genetic distinctness of the Australian bat lyssaviruses, these data also revealed a clear division within the rabies virus clade (Genotype 1) between globally distributed viruses circulating predominantly in canid species (subgroup 1-1), and American strains harbored by both chiropteran and terrestrial hosts (subgroup 1-2). Nucleotide substitution patterns within the P locus suggested differential selection operating along the length of the open reading frame (ORF) between rabies viruses of these two subgroups. Comparison of the deduced primary sequences of the encoded phosphoproteins of all isolates provided insights into the product's structural organization. Two conserved (CD1,2) and two variable (VD1,2) domains were evident; high variation in the VD2 region was reflected by differences in hydropathic profiles. Only two of five serine residues reported to function as phosphate acceptors in the P protein of the rabies challenge virus standard (CVS) strain were absolutely conserved; similarly, out of four internal methionines reported to direct internal translation initiation of the CVS strain to produce N-terminally truncated P proteins, only Met(20) was universally retained. In contrast, two sequence motifs, one believed to confer binding to the cytoplasmic dynein light chain LC8, and a lysine-rich sequence probably contributing to N protein binding, were conserved throughout the genus. Most rabies viruses of the carnivora (1-1) contain a potential C ORF in alternate frame to that of P, a feature limited or absent in most other isolates of the genus, an observation interpreted with consideration to the predicted course of lyssavirus evolution.","['1 Rabies Centre of Expertise, Animal Diseases Research Institute, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 3851 Fallowfield Road, Nepean, Ontario, Canada. nadindaviss@inspection.gc.ca']","S A Nadin-Davis, M Abdel-Malik, J Armstrong, A I Wandeler, ",Virology,2002,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12127791
267,Identification of group A rotaviruses from Zambian fruit bats provides evidence for long-distance dispersal events in Africa,"Group A rotavirus (RVA) is a major cause of diarrhea in children worldwide. Although RVA infects many animals, little is known about RVA in bats. The present study investigated the genetic diversity of RVA in Zambian bats. We identified RVA from two straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), and analyzed the genome sequences of these strains. Genome segments of the RVA strains from Zambian E. helvum showed 97%-99% nucleotide sequence identity with those of other RVA strains from E. helvum in Cameroon, which is 2800 km from the sampling locations. These findings suggest that migratory straw-colored fruit bat species, distributed across sub-Saharan Africa, have the potential to disseminate RVA across long distances. By contrast, the RVA strain from Zambian R. aegyptiacus carried highly divergent NSP2 and NSP4 genes, leading us to propose novel genotypes N21 and E27, respectively. Notably, this RVA strain also shared the same genotype for VP6 and NSP3 with the RVA strains from Zambian E. helvum, suggesting interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment may have occurred between these two bat species in the past.

268,Bat rabies in Guatemala,"Rabies in bats is considered enzootic throughout the New World, but few comparative data are available for most countries in the region. As part of a larger pathogen detection program, enhanced bat rabies surveillance was conducted in Guatemala, between 2009 and 2011. A total of 672 bats of 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies. The prevalence of rabies virus (RABV) detection among all collected bats was low (0.3%). Viral antigens were detected and infectious virus was isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RABV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs and kidneys of both bats, whereas viral RNA was detected in all of the tissues examined by hemi-nested RT-PCR except for the liver of one bat. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that both viruses were 100% identical, whereas sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed one non-synonymous substitution (302T,S). The two vampire bat RABV isolates in this study were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggestive of complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation.","['1 Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Department of Biological Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, United States of America.', '2 United States Department of Agriculture, National Wildlife Research Center, Ft.

269,Genetic reassortment of Rift Valley fever virus in nature,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae family, is an arthropod-borne virus which emerges periodically throughout Africa, emphasizing that it poses a major threat for animal and human populations. To assess the genetic variability of RVFV, several isolates from diverse localities of Africa were investigated by means of reverse transcription-PCR followed by direct sequencing of a region of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genomic segments. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major lineages corresponding to geographic variants from West Africa, Egypt, and Central-East Africa. However, incongruences detected between the L, M, and S phylogenies suggested that genetic exchange via reassortment occurred between strains from different lineages. This hypothesis, depicted by parallel phylogenies, was further confirmed by statistical tests. Our findings, which strongly suggest exchanges between strains from areas of endemicity in West and East Africa, strengthen the potential existence of a sylvatic cycle in the tropical rain forest. This also emphasizes the risk of generating uncontrolled chimeric viruses by using live attenuated vaccines in areas of endemicity.","['1 Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Dakar, Senegal.']","A A Sall, P M Zanotto, O K Sene, H G Zeller, J P Digoutte, Y Thiongane, M Bouloy, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10482570
270,A novel adenovirus isolated from the Egyptian fruit bat in South Africa is closely related to recent isolates from China,"Recently a number of novel adenoviruses have been isolated from diverse bat species and from diverse geographical locations. We describe the isolation of a novel adenovirus (Family Adenoviridae, genus Mastadenovirus) from a pool of liver and spleen tissue of an apparently healthy wild-caught Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in South Africa. Genetically the virus is most closely related to four mastadenoviruses recently isolated in China, from Miniopterus schreibersi and Rousettus leschenaultii bats, which are highly divergent from previously identified bat adenoviruses. The length of the Rousettus aegyptiacus adenovirus-3085 (RaegAdV-3085) genome, at 29,342 bp is similar to its closest relatives, and contains 27 open reading frames. The RaegAdV-3085 genome has a low G + C content (36.4%) relative to other viruses in the genus (between 43.6 and 63.9%) but similar to its closest relatives. The inverted terminal repeat (ITR) of RaegAdV-3085 is only 40 bp compared to between 61 and 178 bp of its closest relatives. The discovery of RaegAdV-3085 expands the diversity of known adenoviruses in bats and might represent a member of a new mastadenovirus species in bats.","['1 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Sandringham, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '2 Centre for Viral Zoonoses, Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '3 Core Sequencing Facility, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Sandringham, Johannesburg, South Africa.', '4 Center for Genome Sciences, United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, USA.', '5 Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Sandringham, Johannesburg, South Africa. januszp@nicd.ac.za.', '6 Centre for Viral Zoonoses, Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa. januszp@nicd.ac.za.', '7 Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. januszp@nicd.ac.za.']","Petrus Jansen van Vuren, Mushal Allam, Michael R Wiley, Arshad Ismail, Nadia Storm, Monica Birkhead, Wanda Markotter, Gustavo Palacios, Janusz T Paweska, ",Scientific reports,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29942032

      Zoonotic transmission events play a major role in the emergence of novel diseases. While such events are virtually impossible to predict, wildlife screening for potential emerging pathogens can be a first step. Driven by recent disease epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola, bats have gained special interest as reservoirs of emerging viruses. Methods:
        
      
      As part of a bigger study investigating pathogens in African bats we screened animals for the presence of known and unknown viruses. Results:
        
      
      We isolated and characterised a novel reovirus from blood of free-tailed bats (Chaereophon aloysiisabaudiae) captured in 2006 in Côte d'Ivoire. The virus showed closest relationship with two human pathogenic viruses, Colorado tick fever virus and Eyach virus, and was able to infect various human cell lines in vitro. Conclusion:
        
      
      The study shows the presence of a coltivirus-related virus in bats from Sub-Sahara Africa.

272,Highly diversified coronaviruses in neotropical bats,"Bats host a broad diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), including close relatives of human pathogens. There is only limited data on neotropical bat CoVs. We analysed faecal, blood and intestine specimens from 1562 bats sampled in Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador and Brazil for CoVs by broad-range PCR. CoV RNA was detected in 50 bats representing nine different species, both frugivorous and insectivorous. These bat CoVs were unrelated to known human or animal pathogens, indicating an absence of recent zoonotic spill-over events. Based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-based grouping units (RGUs) as a surrogate for CoV species identification, the 50 viruses represented five different alphacoronavirus RGUs and two betacoronavirus RGUs. Closely related alphacoronaviruses were detected in Carollia perspicillata and C. brevicauda across a geographical distance exceeding 5600 km. Our study expands the knowledge on CoV diversity in neotropical bats and emphasizes the association of distinct CoVs and bat host genera.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany.', '2 University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation, Hannover, Germany.', '3 Institute of Experimental Ecology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', '4 Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory, University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', '5 School of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', '6 Museum für Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity, Berlin, Germany.', ""7 Fondazione Edmund Mach, Research and Innovation Centre, Department of Biodiversity and Molecular Ecology, S.

273,Molecular diversity of rabies viruses associated with bats in Mexico and other countries of the Americas,"Bat rabies and its transmission to humans and other species in Mexico were investigated. Eighty-nine samples obtained from rabid livestock, cats, dogs, and humans in Mexico were studied by antigenic typing and partial sequence analysis. Samples were further compared with enzootic rabies associated with different species of bats in the Americas. Patterns of nucleotide variation allowed the definition of at least 20 monophyletic clusters associated with 9 or more different bat species. Several lineages associated with distinctive antigenic patterns were found in rabies viruses related to rabies in vampire bats in Mexico. Vampire bat rabies virus lineages associated with antigenic variant 3 are widely spread from Mexico to South America, suggesting these lineages as the most likely ancestors of vampire bat rabies and the ones that have been moved by vampire bat populations throughout the Americas. Rabies viruses related to Lasiurus cinereus, Histiotus montanus, and some other not yet identified species of the genus Lasiurus were found circulating in Mexico. Long-range dissemination patterns of rabies are not necessarily associated with migratory bat species, as in the case of rabies in Desmodus rotundus and Histiotus montanus. Human rabies was associated with vampire bat transmission in most cases, and in one case, rabies transmission from free-tailed bats was inferred. The occurrence of rabies spillover from bats to domestic animals was also demonstrated. Genetic typing of rabies viruses allowed us to distinguish trends of disease dissemination and to address, in a preliminary fashion, aspects of the complex evolution of rabies viruses in different host-reservoir species.","['1 Rabies Unit, Viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd., NE, Mail Stop G33, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. dly3@cdc.gov']","Andrés Velasco-Villa, Lillian A Orciari, Víctor Juárez-Islas, Mauricio Gómez-Sierra, Irma Padilla-Medina, Ana Flisser, Valeria Souza, Amanda Castillo, Richard Franka, Maribel Escalante-Mañe, Isaias Sauri-González, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Journal of clinical microbiology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16672396

275,Phylogenetic relationships of seven previously unclassified viruses within the family Rhabdoviridae using partial nucleoprotein gene sequences,"Partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences of the rhabdoviruses Obodhiang (OBOV), Kotonkon (KOTV), Rochambeau (RBUV), Kern canyon (KCV), Mount Elgon bat (MEBV), Kolongo (KOLV) and Sandjimba (SJAV) were generated and their phylogenetic positions within the family Rhabdoviridae were determined. Both OBOV and KOTV were placed within the genus Ephemerovirus. RBUV was joined to the same cluster, but more distantly. MEBV and KCV were grouped into a monophyletic cluster (putative genus) with Oita virus (OITAV). These three viruses, originating from different regions of the world, were all isolated from insectivorous bats and may be specific for these mammals. African avian viruses KOLV and SJAV were joined to each other and formed another clade at the genus level. Further, they were grouped with the recently characterized rhabdovirus Tupaia virus (TRV). Although the genetic distance was great, the grouping was supported by consistent bootstrap values. This observation suggests that viruses of this group may be distributed widely in the Old World. Non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratio estimations (dN/dS) using a partial N gene fragment (241 codons) for the three rhabdovirus genera revealed contrasting patterns of evolution, where dN/dS values follow the pattern Ephemerovirus > Vesiculovirus > Lyssavirus. The magnitude of this ratio corresponds well with the number of negatively selected codons. The accumulation of dS appears evenly distributed along the gene fragment for all three genera. These estimations demonstrated clearly that lyssaviruses are subjected to the strongest constraints against amino acid substitutions, probably related to their particular niche and unique pathobiology.","['1 Rabies Union, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, MS G-33, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', '2 Laboratory for Clinical and Molecular Virology, The University of Edinburgh, Summerhall, Edinburgh EH9 1QH, UK.']","I V Kuzmin, G J Hughes, C E Rupprecht, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16847128

Moreover, the majority of representatives were identified in western African localities, while only three hantaviruses have been reported in East Africa to date. In this study, a total of 1866 small mammals captured between 2009 and 2014 in various countries of Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Zambia, Mozambique, Kenya, and Tanzania) were molecularly screened for the presence of hantaviruses.

277,Complete genome analysis of 33 ecologically and biologically diverse Rift Valley fever virus strains reveals widespread virus movement and low genetic diversity due to recent common ancestry,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne RNA virus responsible for large explosive outbreaks of acute febrile disease in humans and livestock in Africa with significant mortality and economic impact. The successful high-throughput generation of the complete genome sequence was achieved for 33 diverse RVF virus strains collected from throughout Africa and Saudi Arabia from 1944 to 2000, including strains differing in pathogenicity in disease models. While several distinct virus genetic lineages were determined, which approximately correlate with geographic origin, multiple exceptions indicative of long-distance virus movement have been found. Virus strains isolated within an epidemic (e.g., Mauritania, 1987, or Egypt, 1977 to 1978) exhibit little diversity, while those in enzootic settings (e.g., 1970s Zimbabwe) can be highly diverse. In addition, the large Saudi Arabian RVF outbreak in 2000 appears to have involved virus introduction from East Africa, based on the close ancestral relationship of a 1998 East African virus. Virus genetic diversity was low (approximately 5%) and primarily involved accumulation of mutations at an average of 2.9 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year, although some evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found. Bayesian analysis of current RVF virus genetic diversity places the most recent common ancestor of these viruses in the late 1800s, the colonial period in Africa, a time of dramatic changes in agricultural practices and introduction of nonindigenous livestock breeds. In addition to insights into the evolution and ecology of RVF virus, these genomic data also provide a foundation for the design of molecular detection assays and prototype vaccines useful in combating this important disease.","['1 Special Pathogens Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road MS G-14, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA.']","Brian H Bird, Marina L Khristova, Pierre E Rollin, Thomas G Ksiazek, Stuart T Nichol, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17192303

In close accord with this classification, nucleotide sequencing of representative isolates, at both the N and G loci, identified four principal phylogenetic groups (I-IV), sub-groups of which circulated in particular bat species. Amongst the North American bat viruses, there was a notable division between group I specimens associated with colonial, non-migratory bats (Myotis sp. and Eptesicus fuscus) and those of group II harbored by solitary, migratory species (Lasiurus sp. and Lasionycteris noctivagans). Certain species of Myotis were clearly identified as rabies reservoirs, an observation often obscured previously by their frequent infection by viral variants of other chiroptera. An additional group (III) apparently circulates in E. fuscus, whilst viruses harbored by both insectivorous and haematophagus bats of Latin America clustered to a separate clade (group IV). Comparison of the predicted N and G proteins of these viruses with those of strains of terrestrial mammals indicated a similarity in structural organisation regardless of host species lifestyle. Finally, these sequences permitted examination of the evolutionary relationship of American bat rabies viruses within the Lyssavirus genus.","['1 Rabies Centre of Expertise, Animal Diseases Research Institute, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, P.O.

Bat mortalities occurred in México and Wisconsin, but rabies cases reported herein are only those that occurred after arrival in Madison (n = 15). Bats were confirmed positive for rabies virus (RABV) by the direct fluorescent antibody test. In accordance with previous reports, we observed long incubation periods (more than 100 days), variability in clinical signs prior to death, excretion of virus in saliva, and changes in rabies neutralizing antibody (rVNA) titers post-infection. We observed that the furious form of rabies (aggression, hyper-salivation, and hyper-excitability) manifested in three bats, which has not been reported in vampire bat studies since 1936. RABV was detected in saliva of 5/9 bats, 2-5 days prior to death, but was not detected in four of those bats that had been vaccinated shortly after exposure. Bats from different capture sites were involved in two separate outbreaks, and phylogenetic analysis revealed differences in the glycoprotein gene sequences of RABV isolated from each event, indicating that two different lineages were circulating separately during capture at each site.","['1 Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.', '2 Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', '3 Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, Madison, WI 53718, USA.', '4 US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, Madison, Wisconsin, WI 53711, USA.', '5 Comité Estatal para el Fomento y Protección Pecuaria de San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí 78310, Mexico.']","Elsa M Cárdenas-Canales, Crystal M Gigante, Lauren Greenberg, Andres Velasco-Villa, James A Ellison, Panayampalli S Satheshkumar, Lex G Medina-Magües, Richard Griesser, Elizabeth Falendysz, Ignacio Amezcua, Jorge E Osorio, Tonie E Rocke, ",Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2020,clinical signs; neutralizing antibody; outbreak; rabies virus; vampire bat.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32121499

In the course of a project focused on pathogen discovery in contexts where human-bat contact might facilitate more efficient interspecies transmission of viruses, we surveyed gastrointestinal tissue obtained from bats collected in caves in Nigeria that are frequented by humans. Coronavirus consensus PCR and unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing revealed the presence of coronavirus sequences related to those of SARS-CoV in a Commerson's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni). Additional genomic sequencing indicated that this virus, unlike subgroup 2b CoVs, which includes SARS-CoV, is unique, comprising three overlapping open reading frames between the M and N genes and two conserved stem-loop II motifs.

Recent studies have shown a great diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban-roosting population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in Eidolon helvum across sub-Saharan Africa and on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Longitudinal sampling of E. helvum indicates virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggests spread of AchPVs via horizontal transmission. We also detected possible serological evidence of human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania. It is likely that clinically significant zoonotic spillover of chiropteran paramyxoviruses could be missed throughout much of Africa where health surveillance and diagnostics are poor and comorbidities, such as infection with HIV or Plasmodium sp., are common.","['1 Disease Dynamics Unit, University of Cambridge, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. kf281@cam.ac.uk']","Kate S Baker, Shawn Todd, Glenn A Marsh, Gary Crameri, Jennifer Barr, Alexandra O Kamins, Alison J Peel, Meng Yu, David T S Hayman, Behzad Nadjm, George Mtove, Benjamin Amos, Hugh Reyburn, Edward Nyarko, Richard Suu-Ire, Pablo R Murcia, Andrew A Cunningham, James L N Wood, Lin-Fa Wang, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23152534
282,Further Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown. Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat. Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.IMPORTANCE Global surveillance efforts for undiscovered viruses are an important component of pandemic prevention initiatives. These surveys can be useful for finding novel viruses and for gaining insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors driving viral diversity; however, finding a viral sequence is not sufficient to determine whether it can infect people (i.e., poses a zoonotic threat). Here, we investigated the specific zoonotic risk of a MERS-like coronavirus (PREDICT/PDF-2180) identified in a bat from Uganda and showed that, despite being closely related to MERS-CoV, it is unlikely to pose a threat to humans. We suggest that this approach constitutes an appropriate strategy for beginning to determine the zoonotic potential of wildlife viruses. By showing that PREDICT/PDF-2180 does not infect cells that express the functional receptor for MERS-CoV, we further show that recombination was likely to be the critical step that allowed MERS to emerge in humans.","['1 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA sja2127@cumc.columbia.edu.', '2 Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', '3 EcoHealth Alliance, New York, New York, USA.', '4 One Health Institute and Karen C.

283,Reassortant group A rotavirus from straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum),"Bats are known reservoirs of viral zoonoses. We report genetic characterization of a bat rotavirus (Bat/KE4852/07) detected in the feces of a straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum). Six bat rotavirus genes (viral protein [VP] 2, VP6, VP7, nonstructural protein [NSP] 2, NSP3, and NSP5) shared ancestry with other mammalian rotaviruses but were distantly related. The VP4 gene was nearly identical to that of human P[6] rotavirus strains, and the NSP4 gene was closely related to those of previously described mammalian rotaviruses, including human strains. Analysis of partial sequence of the VP1 gene indicated that it was distinct from cognate genes of other rotaviruses. No sequences were obtained for the VP3 and NSP1 genes of the bat rotavirus. This rotavirus was designated G25-P[6]-I15-R8(provisional)-C8-Mx-Ax-N8-T11-E2-H10. Results suggest that several reassortment events have occurred between human, animal, and bat rotaviruses. Several additional rotavirus strains were detected in bats.","['1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA.']","Mathew D Esona, Slavica Mijatovic-Rustempasic, Christina Conrardy, Suxiang Tong, Ivan V Kuzmin, Bernard Agwanda, Robert F Breiman, Krisztian Banyai, Michael Niezgoda, Charles E Rupprecht, Jon R Gentsch, Michael D Bowen, ",Emerging infectious diseases,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21122212
284,Evidence for an Ancestral Association of Human Coronavirus 229E with Bats,"We previously showed that close relatives of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) exist in African bats. The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3' end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. Importance:
        
      
      The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses. The evolutionary history of HCoV-229E likely shares important characteristics with that of the recently emerged highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany German Centre for Infection Research, (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Bonn, Germany.', '2 Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '3 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany Laboratório de Virologia, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', '4 Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine, Kumasi, Ghana.', '5 Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon.', '6 Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.', '7 Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.', '8 Laboratório de Virologia, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil Instituto da Criança, Hospital das Clínicas da FMUSP, São Paulo, Brazil.', '9 Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, UMR 224 (MIVEGEC), IRD/CNRS/UM1, Montpellier, France.', '10 Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology, Vetsuisse Faculty Bern, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland Federal Department of Home Affairs, Institute of Virology and Immunology, Bern and Mittelhäusern, Switzerland.', '11 Department of Medical Microbiology, Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""12 School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China."", '13 Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Balboa, Panama.', '14 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany German Centre for Infection Research, (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Bonn, Germany drosten@virology-bonn.de drexler@virology-bonn.de.']","Victor Max Corman, Heather J Baldwin, Adriana Fumie Tateno, Rodrigo Melim Zerbinati, Augustina Annan, Michael Owusu, Evans Ewald Nkrumah, Gael Darren Maganga, Samuel Oppong, Yaw Adu-Sarkodie, Peter Vallo, Luiz Vicente Ribeiro Ferreira da Silva Filho, Eric M Leroy, Volker Thiel, Lia van der Hoek, Leo L M Poon, Marco Tschapka, Christian Drosten, Jan Felix Drexler, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26378164
285,Bats worldwide carry hepatitis E virus-related viruses that form a putative novel genus within the family Hepeviridae,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food-borne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family Hepeviridae. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence for the transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Full-genome analysis of one representative virus confirmed formal classification within the family Hepeviridae. Sequence- and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family Hepeviridae and that at least three other genera comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be designated. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts nonrecently and underwent speciation according to their host restrictions. Human HEV-related viruses in farmed and peridomestic animals might represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses, rather than animal precursors causally involved in the evolution of human HEV.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, Bonn, Germany.']","Jan Felix Drexler, Annika Seelen, Victor Max Corman, Adriana Fumie Tateno, Veronika Cottontail, Rodrigo Melim Zerbinati, Florian Gloza-Rausch, Stefan M Klose, Yaw Adu-Sarkodie, Samuel K Oppong, Elisabeth K V Kalko, Andreas Osterman, Andrea Rasche, Alexander Adam, Marcel A Müller, Rainer G Ulrich, Eric M Leroy, Alexander N Lukashev, Christian Drosten, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22696648
286,Bats carry pathogenic hepadnaviruses antigenically related to hepatitis B virus and capable of infecting human hepatocytes,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV), family Hepadnaviridae, is one of most relevant human pathogens. HBV origins are enigmatic, and no zoonotic reservoirs are known. Here, we screened 3,080 specimens from 54 bat species representing 11 bat families for hepadnaviral DNA. Ten specimens (0.3%) from Panama and Gabon yielded unique hepadnaviruses in coancestral relation to HBV. Full genome sequencing allowed classification as three putative orthohepadnavirus species based on genome lengths (3,149-3,377 nt), presence of middle HBV surface and X-protein genes, and sequence distance criteria. Hepatic tropism in bats was shown by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. Infected livers showed histopathologic changes compatible with hepatitis. Human hepatocytes transfected with all three bat viruses cross-reacted with sera against the HBV core protein, concordant with the phylogenetic relatedness of these hepadnaviruses and HBV. One virus from Uroderma bilobatum, the tent-making bat, cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies against the HBV antigenicity determining S domain. Up to 18.4% of bat sera contained antibodies against bat hepadnaviruses. Infectious clones were generated to study all three viruses in detail. Hepatitis D virus particles pseudotyped with surface proteins of U. bilobatum HBV, but neither of the other two viruses could infect primary human and Tupaia belangeri hepatocytes. Hepatocyte infection occurred through the human HBV receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide but could not be neutralized by sera from vaccinated humans. Antihepadnaviral treatment using an approved reverse transcriptase inhibitor blocked replication of all bat hepadnaviruses. Our data suggest that bats may have been ancestral sources of primate hepadnaviruses. The observed zoonotic potential might affect concepts aimed at eradicating HBV.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, 53127 Bonn, Germany.']","Jan Felix Drexler, Andreas Geipel, Alexander König, Victor M Corman, Debby van Riel, Lonneke M Leijten, Corinna M Bremer, Andrea Rasche, Veronika M Cottontail, Gael D Maganga, Mathias Schlegel, Marcel A Müller, Alexander Adam, Stefan M Klose, Aroldo José Borges Carneiro, Andreas Stöcker, Carlos Roberto Franke, Florian Gloza-Rausch, Joachim Geyer, Augustina Annan, Yaw Adu-Sarkodie, Samuel Oppong, Tabea Binger, Peter Vallo, Marco Tschapka, Rainer G Ulrich, Wolfram H Gerlich, Eric Leroy, Thijs Kuiken, Dieter Glebe, Christian Drosten, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2013,evolution; metagenomics; reverse genetics; virome; zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24043818
287,Surveillance of Bat Coronaviruses in Kenya Identifies Relatives of Human Coronaviruses NL63 and 229E and Their Recombination History,"Bats harbor a large diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), several of which are related to zoonotic pathogens that cause severe disease in humans. Our screening of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from several novel CoVs but, more significantly, identified sequences that were closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5' and 3' ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies recombination events involving the S gene were identified, suggesting that this region may represent a recombination ""hot spot"" in CoV genomes. Finally, using a combination of phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, we showed that the genetic diversity of bat CoVs is primarily structured by host species and subsequently by geographic distances.IMPORTANCE Understanding the driving forces of cross-species virus transmission is central to understanding the nature of disease emergence. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats are the ultimate reservoir hosts for a number of coronaviruses (CoVs), including ancestors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E). However, the evolutionary pathways of bat CoVs remain elusive. We provide evidence for natural recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses associated with Triaenops afer and Hipposideros sp. bats that resulted in a NL63-like virus, an ancestor of the human pathogen HCoV-NL63. These results suggest that interspecies recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of novel CoVs with zoonotic potential.","['1 Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', '2 Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', '3 Centre for Viral Zoonoses, Department of Medical Virology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', '4 Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', '5 Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA sot1@cdc.gov.']","Ying Tao, Mang Shi, Christina Chommanard, Krista Queen, Jing Zhang, Wanda Markotter, Ivan V Kuzmin, Edward C Holmes, Suxiang Tong, ",Journal of virology,2017,Africa; HCoV-229E; HCoV-NL63; bats; coronavirus; recombination; zoonoses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28077633

290,Relatives of rubella virus in diverse mammals,"Since 1814, when rubella was first described, the origins of the disease and its causative agent, rubella virus (Matonaviridae: Rubivirus), have remained unclear1. Here we describe ruhugu virus and rustrela virus in Africa and Europe, respectively, which are, to our knowledge, the first known relatives of rubella virus. Ruhugu virus, which is the closest relative of rubella virus, was found in apparently healthy cyclops leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros cyclops) in Uganda. Rustrela virus, which is an outgroup to the clade that comprises rubella and ruhugu viruses, was found in acutely encephalitic placental and marsupial animals at a zoo in Germany and in wild yellow-necked field mice (Apodemus flavicollis) at and near the zoo. Ruhugu and rustrela viruses share an identical genomic architecture with rubella virus2,3. The amino acid sequences of four putative B cell epitopes in the fusion (E1) protein of the rubella, ruhugu and rustrela viruses and two putative T cell epitopes in the capsid protein of the rubella and ruhugu viruses are moderately to highly conserved4-6. Modelling of E1 homotrimers in the post-fusion state predicts that ruhugu and rubella viruses have a similar capacity for fusion with the host-cell membrane5. Together, these findings show that some members of the family Matonaviridae can cross substantial barriers between host species and that rubella virus probably has a zoonotic origin. Our findings raise concerns about future zoonotic transmission of rubella-like viruses, but will facilitate comparative studies and animal models of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome.","['1 Department of Pathobiological Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', '2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '3 Leidos, Reston, VA, USA.', '4 Genomics and Bioinformatics Department, Biological Defense Research Directorate, Naval Medical Research Center-Frederick, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD, USA.', '5 Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', '6 State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fisheries, Rostock, Germany.', '7 Department of Experimental Animal Facilities and Biorisk Management, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', '8 Institute of Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', '9 German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Hamburg-Lübeck-Borstel-Insel Riems, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', '10 Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD, USA.', '11 Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany. martin.beer@fli.de.', '12 Department of Pathobiological Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. tony.goldberg@wisc.edu.', '13 Global Health Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. tony.goldberg@wisc.edu.']","Andrew J Bennett, Adrian C Paskey, Arnt Ebinger, Florian Pfaff, Grit Priemer, Dirk Höper, Angele Breithaupt, Elisa Heuser, Rainer G Ulrich, Jens H Kuhn, Kimberly A Bishop-Lilly, Martin Beer, Tony L Goldberg, ",Nature,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33029010

292,Portable Rabies Virus Sequencing in Canine Rabies Endemic Countries Using the Oxford Nanopore MinION,"As countries with endemic canine rabies progress towards elimination by 2030, it will become necessary to employ techniques to help plan, monitor, and confirm canine rabies elimination. Sequencing can provide critical information to inform control and vaccination strategies by identifying genetically distinct virus variants that may have different host reservoir species or geographic distributions. However, many rabies testing laboratories lack the resources or expertise for sequencing, especially in remote or rural areas where human rabies deaths are highest. We developed a low-cost, high throughput rabies virus sequencing method using the Oxford Nanopore MinION portable sequencer. A total of 259 sequences were generated from diverse rabies virus isolates in public health laboratories lacking rabies virus sequencing capacity in Guatemala, India, Kenya, and Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis provided valuable insight into rabies virus diversity and distribution in these countries and identified a new rabies virus lineage in Kenya, the first published canine rabies virus sequence from Guatemala, evidence of rabies spread across an international border in Vietnam, and importation of a rabid dog into a state working to become rabies-free in India.

The paramyxoviral Pararubulavirus genus contains viruses mostly derived from bats that are common, diverse, distributed throughout the Old World, and known to be zoonotic. Here, we describe a new member of the genus Achimota pararubulavirus 3 (AchPV3) and its isolation from the urine of African straw-coloured fruit bats on primary bat kidneys cells. We sequenced and analysed the genome of AchPV3 relative to other Paramyxoviridae, revealing it to be similar to known pararubulaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of AchPV3 revealed the failure of molecular detection in the urine sample from which AchPV3 was derived and an attachment protein most closely related with AchPV2-a pararubulavirus known to cause cross-species transmission. Together these findings add to the picture of pararubulaviruses, their sources, and variable zoonotic potential, which is key to our understanding of host restriction and spillover of bat-derived paramyxoviruses.

However, deep sequencing and metagenomic analyses identified a novel paramyxovirus, later named Sosuga virus, in the patient's blood. To determine the potential source, bat tissues collected during the 3-wk period just prior to the onset of symptoms were tested for Sosuga virus, and several Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) were found to be positive.

295,Coronaviruses in bats from Mexico,"Bats are reservoirs for a wide range of human pathogens including Nipah, Hendra, rabies, Ebola, Marburg and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV). The recent implication of a novel beta (β)-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population. In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs. Nine were alpha (α)-CoVs; four were β-CoVs. Twelve were novel. Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs. A β-CoV with 96.5 % amino acid identity to the β-CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae. While it is important to investigate unknown viral diversity in bats, it is also important to remember that the majority of viruses they carry will not pose any clinical risk, and bats should not be stigmatized ubiquitously as significant threats to public health.","['1 EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, NY, USA.', '2 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168th Street, NY, USA.', '3 Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510, México D.F.

296,Evolution of genome size and complexity in the rhabdoviridae,"RNA viruses exhibit substantial structural, ecological and genomic diversity. However, genome size in RNA viruses is likely limited by a high mutation rate, resulting in the evolution of various mechanisms to increase complexity while minimising genome expansion. Here we conduct a large-scale analysis of the genome sequences of 99 animal rhabdoviruses, including 45 genomes which we determined de novo, to identify patterns of genome expansion and the evolution of genome complexity. All but seven of the rhabdoviruses clustered into 17 well-supported monophyletic groups, of which eight corresponded to established genera, seven were assigned as new genera, and two were taxonomically ambiguous. We show that the acquisition and loss of new genes appears to have been a central theme of rhabdovirus evolution, and has been associated with the appearance of alternative, overlapping and consecutive ORFs within the major structural protein genes, and the insertion and loss of additional ORFs in each gene junction in a clade-specific manner. Changes in the lengths of gene junctions accounted for as much as 48.5% of the variation in genome size from the smallest to the largest genome, and the frequency with which new ORFs were observed increased in the 3' to 5' direction along the genome. We also identify several new families of accessory genes encoded in these regions, and show that non-canonical expression strategies involving TURBS-like termination-reinitiation, ribosomal frame-shifts and leaky ribosomal scanning appear to be common. We conclude that rhabdoviruses have an unusual capacity for genomic plasticity that may be linked to their discontinuous transcription strategy from the negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, and propose a model that accounts for the regular occurrence of genome expansion and contraction throughout the evolution of the Rhabdoviridae.","['1 CSIRO Biosecurity, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America.', '3 Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases and Department of Pathology, Center for Tropical Diseases, and Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America.', '4 Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Biological Sciences and Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']","Peter J Walker, Cadhla Firth, Steven G Widen, Kim R Blasdell, Hilda Guzman, Thomas G Wood, Prasad N Paradkar, Edward C Holmes, Robert B Tesh, Nikos Vasilakis, ",PLoS pathogens,2015,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25679389
297,Evolutionary origins of hepatitis A virus in small mammals,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an ancient and ubiquitous human pathogen recovered previously only from primates. The sole species of the genus Hepatovirus, existing in both enveloped and nonenveloped forms, and with a capsid structure intermediate between that of insect viruses and mammalian picornaviruses, HAV is enigmatic in its origins. We conducted a targeted search for hepatoviruses in 15,987 specimens collected from 209 small mammal species globally and discovered highly diversified viruses in bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews, which by pairwise sequence distance comprise 13 novel Hepatovirus species. Near-complete genomes from nine of these species show conservation of unique hepatovirus features, including predicted internal ribosome entry site structure, a truncated VP4 capsid protein lacking N-terminal myristoylation, a carboxyl-terminal pX extension of VP1, VP2 late domains involved in membrane envelopment, and a cis-acting replication element within the 3D(pol) sequence. Antibodies in some bat sera immunoprecipitated and neutralized human HAV, suggesting conservation of critical antigenic determinants. Limited phylogenetic cosegregation among hepatoviruses and their hosts and recombination patterns are indicative of major hepatovirus host shifts in the past. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest a Hepatovirus origin in small insectivorous mammals and a rodent origin of human HAV. Patterns of infection in small mammals mimicked those of human HAV in hepatotropism, fecal shedding, acute nature, and extinction of the virus in a closed host population. The evolutionary conservation of hepatovirus structure and pathogenesis provide novel insight into the origins of HAV and highlight the utility of analyzing animal reservoirs for risk assessment of emerging viruses.","['1 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, 53127 Bonn, Germany; German Centre for Infection Research, Bonn-Cologne, Germany; drexler@virology-bonn.de.', '2 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, 53127 Bonn, Germany; German Centre for Infection Research, Bonn-Cologne, Germany;', '3 Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, Moscow 142782, Russia;', '4 Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', '5 Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, Moscow 142782, Russia; Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow 119991, Russia;', '6 Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre, 53127 Bonn, Germany;', '7 Laboratory of Virus Research, University of Bremen, 28359 Bremen, Germany;', '8 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7292;', '9 Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, University of Ulm, 89069 Ulm, Germany;', '10 Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, 17493 Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.']","Jan Felix Drexler, Victor M Corman, Alexander N Lukashev, Judith M A van den Brand, Anatoly P Gmyl, Sebastian Brünink, Andrea Rasche, Nicole Seggewiβ, Hui Feng, Lonneke M Leijten, Peter Vallo, Thijs Kuiken, Andreas Dotzauer, Rainer G Ulrich, Stanley M Lemon, Christian Drosten, Hepatovirus Ecology Consortium, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2015,hepatitis A virus; pathogenesis; small mammals; viral evolution; zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26575627
298,The phylogeography of Myotis bat-associated rabies viruses across Canada,"As rabies in carnivores is increasingly controlled throughout much of the Americas, bats are emerging as a significant source of rabies virus infection of humans and domestic animals. Knowledge of the bat species that maintain rabies is a crucial first step in reducing this public health problem. In North America, several bat species are known to be rabies virus reservoirs but the role of bats of the Myotis genus has been unclear due to the scarcity of laboratory confirmed cases and the challenges encountered in species identification of poorly preserved diagnostic submissions by morphological traits alone. This study has employed a collection of rabid bat specimens collected across Canada over a 25 year period to clearly define the role of particular Myotis species as rabies virus reservoirs. The virus was characterised by partial genome sequencing and host genetic barcoding, used to confirm species assignment of specimens, proved crucial to the identification of certain bat species as disease reservoirs. Several variants were associated with Myotis species limited in their Canadian range to the westernmost province of British Columbia while others were harboured by Myotis species that circulate across much of eastern and central Canada. All of these Myotis-associated viral variants, except for one, clustered as a monophyletic MYCAN clade, which has emerged from a lineage more broadly distributed across North America; in contrast one distinct variant, associated with the long-legged bat in Canada, represents a relatively recent host jump from a big brown bat reservoir. Together with evidence from South America, these findings demonstrate that rabies virus has emerged in the Myotis genus independently on multiple occasions and highlights the potential for emergence of new viral-host associations within this genus.","['1 Animal Health Microbiology Research, Ottawa Laboratory Fallowfield, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', '2 Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', '3 Centre of Expertise for Rabies, Ottawa Laboratory Fallowfield, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa, ON, Canada.']","Susan Nadin-Davis, Noor Alnabelseya, M Kimberly Knowles, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2017,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28542160

302,Multidisciplinary approach to epizootiology and pathogenesis of bat rabies viruses in the United States,"Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically initiated after an animal pathogen has caused disease in humans. Early detection of potentially high-risk pathogens within animal hosts may facilitate medical interventions to cope with an emerging disease. To effectively spillover to a novel host, a pathogen may undergo genetic changes resulting in varying transmission potential in the new host and potentially to humans. Rabies virus (RABV) is one model pathogen to consider for studying the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases under both laboratory and field conditions. The evolutionary history of RABV is characterized by regularly documented spillover infections and a series of notable host shifts. Within this context, enhanced field surveillance to improve detection of spillover infections will require validated techniques to non-invasively differentiate infected from non-infected individuals. In this study, we evaluate the use of infrared thermography to detect thermal changes associated with experimental RABV infection in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in a captive colony. Our results indicated that 62% of rabid bats had detectable facial temperature decreases (-4.6°C, SD ± 2.5) compared with pre-inoculation baseline values. These data suggest potential utility for discriminating rabid bats in natural field settings. In addition, focusing upon RABV circulating in the United States between 2008 and 2011, we confirmed spillover events of bat RABV among carnivores and identified cross-species transmission events caused by four lineages of RABV associated with insectivorous bats. Additionally, our analysis of RABV glycoprotein sequences identified substitutions in antigenic sites that may affect neutralizing activity associated with monoclonal antibodies proposed for use in human post-exposure prophylaxis. This study provides a glimpse into RABV pathobiology and spillover dynamics among and between bats and a variety of mesocarnivores.","['1 Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.']","J A Ellison, S R Johnson, N Kuzmina, A Gilbert, W C Carson, K C VerCauteren, C E Rupprecht, ",Zoonoses and public health,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23137052

In this study, 30 pooled-guano samples were collected from a cave roost of Myotis velifer in Oklahoma. A portion of the DNA polymerase gene from Adenoviridae was amplified successfully in 18 M. velifer samples; however, DNA sequence was obtained from only 6 of these M. velifer samples.

304,"Genetic divergence of rabies viruses from bat species of Colorado, USA","Molecular epidemiological studies have linked many cryptic human rabies cases in the United States with exposure to rabies virus (RV) variants associated with insectivorous bats. In Colorado, bats accounted for 98% of all reported animal rabies cases between 1977 and 1996. The genetic divergence of RV was investigated in bat and terrestrial animal specimens that were submitted for rabies diagnosis to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), Colorado, USA. RV isolates from animal specimens across the United States were also included in the analysis. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences, which revealed seven principal clades. RV associated with the colonial big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, an bats of the genus Myotis were found to segregate into two distinct clades (I and IV). Clade I was harbored by E. fuscus and Myotis species, but was also identified in terrestrial animals such as domestic cats and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Clade IV was divided into subclades IVA, IVB, and IVC; IVA was identified in E. fuscus, and Myotis species bats, and also in a fox; subclades IVB and IVC circulated predominantly in E. fuscus. Clade II was formed by big free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops macrotis) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) samples. Clade III included RVs that are maintained by generally solitary, migratory bats such as the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and bats of the genus Lasiurus. Big brown bats were found to harbor this RV variant. None of the Colorado specimens segregated with clades V and VII that harbor RVs associated with terrestrial animals. Different species of bats had the same RV variant, indicating active inter-species rabies transmission. In Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats, and the identification of bat RVs in cat, gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and striped skunks demonstrated the importance of rabies spillover from bats to domestic and terrestrial wildlife species.","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. vbs2@cdc.gov']","Vidya Shankar, Lillian A Orciari, Cecilia De Mattos, Ivan V Kuzmin, W John Pape, Thomas J O'Shea, Charles E Rupprecht, ","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16417429

We sampled feces and/or anal swabs of 1,044 insectivorous bats of 2 families and 17 species from 21 different locations within Colorado from 2007 to 2009. We detected alphacoronavirus RNA in bats of 4 species: big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 10% prevalence; long-legged bats (Myotis volans), 8% prevalence; little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), 3% prevalence; and western long-eared bats (Myotis evotis), 2% prevalence. Overall, juvenile bats were twice as likely to be positive for CoV RNA as adult bats. At two of the rural sampling sites, CoV RNAs were detected in big brown and long-legged bats during the three sequential summers of this study. CoV RNA was detected in big brown bats in all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled throughout each of the periods tested. Individually tagged big brown bats that were positive for CoV RNA and later sampled again all became CoV RNA negative. Nucleotide sequences in the RdRp gene fell into 3 main clusters, all distinct from those of Old World bats. Similar nucleotide sequences were found in amplicons from gene 1b and the spike gene in both a big-brown and a long-legged bat, indicating that a CoV may be capable of infecting bats of different genera. These data suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats creates the possibility of a continued threat for emergence into hosts of other species. Alphacoronavirus RNA was detected at a high prevalence in big brown bats in roosts in close proximity to human habitations (10%) and known to have direct contact with people (19%), suggesting that significant potential opportunities exist for cross-species transmission of these viruses. Further CoV surveillance studies in bats throughout the Americas are warranted.","['1 Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.']","Christina Osborne, Paul M Cryan, Thomas J O'Shea, Lauren M Oko, Christina Ndaluka, Charles H Calisher, Andrew D Berglund, Mead L Klavetter, Richard A Bowen, Kathryn V Holmes, Samuel R Dominguez, ",PloS one,2011,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21589915
306,Molecular inferences suggest multiple host shifts of rabies viruses from bats to mesocarnivores in Arizona during 2001-2009,"In nature, rabies virus (RABV; genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae) represents an assemblage of phylogenetic lineages, associated with specific mammalian host species. Although it is generally accepted that RABV evolved originally in bats and further shifted to carnivores, mechanisms of such host shifts are poorly understood, and examples are rarely present in surveillance data. Outbreaks in carnivores caused by a RABV variant, associated with big brown bats, occurred repeatedly during 2001-2009 in the Flagstaff area of Arizona. After each outbreak, extensive control campaigns were undertaken, with no reports of further rabies cases in carnivores for the next several years. However, questions remained whether all outbreaks were caused by a single introduction and further perpetuation of bat RABV in carnivore populations, or each outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of a bat virus. Another question of concern was related to adaptive changes in the RABV genome associated with host shifts. To address these questions, we sequenced and analyzed 66 complete and 20 nearly complete RABV genomes, including those from the Flagstaff area and other similar outbreaks in carnivores, caused by bat RABVs, and representatives of the major RABV lineages circulating in North America and worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that each Flagstaff outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of bat RABV into populations of carnivores. Positive selection analysis confirmed the absence of post-shift changes in RABV genes. In contrast, convergent evolution analysis demonstrated several amino acids in the N, P, G and L proteins, which might be significant for pre-adaptation of bat viruses to cause effective infection in carnivores. The substitution S/T₂₄₂ in the viral glycoprotein is of particular merit, as a similar substitution was suggested for pathogenicity of Nishigahara RABV strain. Roles of the amino acid changes, detected in our study, require additional investigations, using reverse genetics and other approaches.","['1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America. ibk3@cdc.gov']","Ivan V Kuzmin, Mang Shi, Lillian A Orciari, Pamela A Yager, Andres Velasco-Villa, Natalia A Kuzmina, Daniel G Streicker, David L Bergman, Charles E Rupprecht, ",PLoS pathogens,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22737076
307,Rates of viral evolution are linked to host geography in bat rabies,"Rates of evolution span orders of magnitude among RNA viruses with important implications for viral transmission and emergence. Although the tempo of viral evolution is often ascribed to viral features such as mutation rates and transmission mode, these factors alone cannot explain variation among closely related viruses, where host biology might operate more strongly on viral evolution. Here, we analyzed sequence data from hundreds of rabies viruses collected from bats throughout the Americas to describe dramatic variation in the speed of rabies virus evolution when circulating in ecologically distinct reservoir species. Integration of ecological and genetic data through a comparative bayesian analysis revealed that viral evolutionary rates were labile following historical jumps between bat species and nearly four times faster in tropical and subtropical bats compared to temperate species. The association between geography and viral evolution could not be explained by host metabolism, phylogeny or variable selection pressures, and instead appeared to be a consequence of reduced seasonality in bat activity and virus transmission associated with climate. Our results demonstrate a key role for host ecology in shaping the tempo of evolution in multi-host viruses and highlight the power of comparative phylogenetic methods to identify the host and environmental features that influence transmission dynamics.","['1 Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, United States of America. dstrike@uga.edu']","Daniel G Streicker, Philippe Lemey, Andres Velasco-Villa, Charles E Rupprecht, ",PLoS pathogens,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22615575

The incidence of non-lethal RV exposure, based on the presence of viral neutralizing antibodies, demonstrates that exposure to RV does not always lead to clinical infection in bats. It is unknown how the route of exposure, rabies virus variant, or health of the bat affects the outcome following exposure.

These data supported the monophyletic nature of all terrestrial rabies viruses presently circulating in Cuba but additionally delineated several distinct variants exhibiting limited spatial distribution which may reflect the history of rabies spread on the island. The strain of rabies currently circulating in Cuba, which emerged on the island in the early 20th century, has very close evolutionary ties to the Mexican dog type and is a member of the cosmopolitan lineage widely distributed during the colonial period. The Cuban rabies viruses, which circulate predominantly within the mongoose population, are phylogenetically distant from viruses circulating in mongooses in other parts of the world. These studies illustrate, at a global level, the adaptation of multiple strains of rabies to mongoose species which should be regarded as important wildlife hosts for rabies re-emergence.

In samples derived from these bats, we identified viral sequences that were similar to at least three novel group 1 CoVs, large numbers of insect and plant virus sequences, and nearly full-length genomic sequences of two novel bacteriophages. These observations suggest that bats encounter and disseminate a large assortment of viruses capable of infecting many different animals, insects, and plants in nature.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. eric_donaldson@med.unc.edu']","Eric F Donaldson, Aimee N Haskew, J Edward Gates, Jeremy Huynh, Clea J Moore, Matthew B Frieman, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20926577
313,Detection of group 1 coronaviruses in bats in North America,"The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Bats of several species in southern People's Republic of China harbor SARS-like CoVs and may be reservoir hosts for them. To determine whether bats in North America also harbor coronaviruses, we used reverse transcription-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA in bats. We found coronavirus RNA in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested. The prevalence of viral RNA shedding was high: 17% in Eptesicus fuscus and 50% in Myotis occultus. Sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats. Because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals, further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in North America are needed.","['1 University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.']","Samuel R Dominguez, Thomas J O'Shea, Lauren M Oko, Kathryn V Holmes, ",Emerging infectious diseases,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18252098
314,Identification of viral genomic elements responsible for rabies virus neuroinvasiveness,"Attenuated tissue culture-adapted and natural street rabies virus (RV) strains differ greatly in their neuroinvasiveness. To identify the elements responsible for the ability of an RV to enter the CNS from a peripheral site and to cause lethal neurological disease, we constructed a full-length cDNA clone of silver-haired bat-associated RV (SHBRV) strain 18 and exchanged the genes encoding RV proteins and genomic sequences of this highly neuroinvasive RV strain with those of a highly attenuated nonneuroinvasive RV vaccine strain (SN0). Analysis of the recombinant RV (SB0), which was recovered from SHBRV-18 cDNA, indicated that this RV is phenotypically indistinguishable from WT SHBRV-18. Characterization of the chimeric viruses revealed that in addition to the RV glycoprotein, which plays a predominant role in the ability of an RV to invade the CNS from a peripheral site, viral elements such as the trailer sequence, the RV polymerase, and the pseudogene contribute to RV neuroinvasiveness. Analyses also revealed that neuroinvasiveness of an RV correlates inversely with the time necessary for internalization of RV virions and with the capacity of the virus to grow in neuroblastoma cells.","['1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, 1020 Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']","Milosz Faber, Rojjanaporn Pulmanausahakul, Kazuhiko Nagao, Mikhail Prosniak, Amy B Rice, Hilary Koprowski, Matthias J Schnell, Bernhard Dietzschold, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2004,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15520387
315,Host switching in Lyssavirus history from the Chiroptera to the Carnivora orders,"Lyssaviruses are unsegmented RNA viruses causing rabies. Their vectors belong to the Carnivora and Chiroptera orders. We studied 36 carnivoran and 17 chiropteran lyssaviruses representing the main genotypes and variants. We compared their genes encoding the surface glycoprotein, which is responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The glycoprotein is the main protecting antigen and bears virulence determinants. Point mutation is the main force in lyssavirus evolution, as Sawyer's test and phylogenetic analysis showed no evidence of recombination. Tests of neutrality indicated a neutral model of evolution, also supported by globally high ratios of synonymous substitutions (d(S)) to nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) (>7). Relative-rate tests suggested similar rates of evolution for all lyssavirus lineages. Therefore, the absence of recombination and similar evolutionary rates make phylogeny-based conclusions reliable. Phylogenetic reconstruction strongly supported the hypothesis that host switching occurred in the history of lyssaviruses. Indeed, lyssaviruses evolved in chiropters long before the emergence of carnivoran rabies, very likely following spillovers from bats. Using dated isolates, the average rate of evolution was estimated to be roughly 4.3 x 10(-4) d(S)/site/year. Consequently, the emergence of carnivoran rabies from chiropteran lyssaviruses was determined to have occurred 888 to 1,459 years ago. Glycoprotein segments accumulating more d(N) than d(S) were distinctly detected in carnivoran and chiropteran lyssaviruses. They may have contributed to the adaptation of the virus to the two distinct mammal orders. In carnivoran lyssaviruses they overlapped the main antigenic sites, II and III, whereas in chiropteran lyssaviruses they were located in regions of unknown functions.","['1 Laboratoire des Lyssavirus, Department of Virology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']","H Badrane, N Tordo, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11483755
316,"Characterization of Eptesipoxvirus, a novel poxvirus from a microchiropteran bat","The genome of Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) is the first poxvirus genome isolated from a microbat. The 176,688 nt sequence, which is believed to encompass the complete coding region of the virus, is 67% A+T and is predicted to encode 191 genes. 11 of these genes have no counterpart in GenBank and are therefore unique to EPTV. The presence of a distantly related ortholog of Vaccinia virus F5L in EPTV uncovered a link with fragmented F5L orthologs in Molluscum contagiosum virus/squirrelpox and clade II viruses. Consistent with the unique position of EPTV approximately mid-point between the orthopoxviruses and the clade II viruses, EPTV has 11 genes that are specific to the orthopoxviruses and 13 genes that are typical, if not exclusive, to the clade II poxviruses. This mosaic nature of EPTV blurs the distinction between the old description of the orthopoxvirus and clade II groups. Genome annotation and characterization failed to find any common virulence genes shared with the other poxvirus isolated from bat (pteropoxvirus); however, EPTV encodes 3 genes that may have been transferred to or from deerpox and squirrelpox viruses; 2 of these, a putative endothelin-like protein and a MHC class I-like protein are likely to have immunomodulatory roles.","['1 Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.', '2 The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.', '3 Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada. cupton@uvic.ca.']","Shin-Lin Tu, Yoshinori Nakazawa, Jinxin Gao, Kimberly Wilkins, Nadia Gallardo-Romero, Yu Li, Ginny L Emerson, Darin S Carroll, Chris Upton, ",Virus genes,NO_DATE,Batpox; Eptesipoxvirus; NGS; Next-generation sequencing; Poxvirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28685222
317,Evidence supporting a zoonotic origin of human coronavirus strain NL63,"The relationship between bats and coronaviruses (CoVs) has received considerable attention since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like CoV was identified in the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophidae) in 2005. Since then, several bats throughout the world have been shown to shed CoV sequences, and presumably CoVs, in the feces; however, no bat CoVs have been isolated from nature. Moreover, there are very few bat cell lines or reagents available for investigating CoV replication in bat cells or for isolating bat CoVs adapted to specific bat species. Here, we show by molecular clock analysis that alphacoronavirus (α-CoV) sequences derived from the North American tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) are predicted to share common ancestry with human CoV (HCoV)-NL63, with the most recent common ancestor between these viruses occurring approximately 563 to 822 years ago. Further, we developed immortalized bat cell lines from the lungs of this bat species to determine if these cells were capable of supporting infection with HCoVs. While SARS-CoV, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), and chimeric SARS-CoVs bearing the spike genes of early human strains replicated inefficiently, HCoV-NL63 replicated for multiple passages in the immortalized lung cells from this bat species. These observations support the hypothesis that human CoVs are capable of establishing zoonotic-reverse zoonotic transmission cycles that may allow some CoVs to readily circulate and exchange genetic material between strains found in bats and other mammals, including humans.","['1 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']","Jeremy Huynh, Shimena Li, Boyd Yount, Alexander Smith, Leslie Sturges, John C Olsen, Juliet Nagel, Joshua B Johnson, Sudhakar Agnihothram, J Edward Gates, Matthew B Frieman, Ralph S Baric, Eric F Donaldson, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22993147

Sixty-nine faecal samples and 126 carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses. A phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence fragments aided in identifying two alphacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), three clade 2b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and 10 clade 2c betacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), and Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii).

320,Complete genome sequence of Tacaribe virus,"Tacaribe virus (TCRV) is the prototype of the New World arenaviruses (also known as TCRV serocomplex viruses). While TCRV is not itself a human pathogen, many closely related members of this group cause hemorrhagic fever, and thus TCRV has long served as an important BSL2 system for research into diverse areas of arenavirus biology. Due to its widespread use, a coding-complete sequence for both the S and L segments of the bipartite genome has been publically available for almost 30 years. However, more recently, this sequence has been found to contain significant discrepancies compared to other samples of the same original strain (i.e., TRVL-11573). Further, it is incomplete with respect to the genome ends, which contain critical regulatory elements for RNA synthesis. In order to rectify these issues we now present the first complete genome sequence for this important prototype arenavirus. In addition to completing the S segment 5' end, we identified an apparent error in the L segment 3' end as well as substantial discrepancies in the S segment intergenic region likely to affect folding. Comparison of this sequence with existing partial sequences confirmed a 12-amino-acid deletion in GP, including putative glycosylation sites, and a 4-amino-acid exchange flanking the exonuclease domain of NP. Accounting for these corrections, the TRVL-11573 strain appears to be nearly identical to that isolated in Florida in 2012. The availability of this information provides a solid basis for future molecular and genetic work on this important prototype arenavirus.","['1 Junior Research Group Arenavirus Biology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Südufer 10, Greifswald, Insel Riems, Germany.', '2 Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland.', '3 Junior Research Group Arenavirus Biology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Südufer 10, Greifswald, Insel Riems, Germany. allison.groseth@fli.de.']","Julia Holzerland, Anne Leske, Lucie Fénéant, Dominique Garcin, Daniel Kolakofsky, Allison Groseth, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32462284

322,Evolution and Cryo-electron Microscopy Capsid Structure of a North American Bat Adenovirus and Its Relationship to Other Mastadenoviruses,"Since the first description of adenoviruses in bats in 2006, a number of micro- and megabat species in Europe, Africa, and Asia have been shown to carry a wide diversity of adenoviruses. Here, we report on the evolutionary, biological, and structural characterization of a novel bat adenovirus (BtAdV) recovered from a Rafinesque's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in Kentucky, USA, which is the first adenovirus isolated from North American bats. This virus (BtAdV 250-A) exhibits a close phylogenetic relationship with Canine mastadenovirus A (CAdV A), as previously observed with other BtAdVs. To further investigate the relationships between BtAdVs and CAdVs, we conducted mass spectrometric analysis and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of the BtAdV 250-A capsid and also analyzed the in vitro host ranges of both viruses. Our results demonstrate that BtAdV 250-A represents a new mastadenovirus species that, in contrast to CAdV, has a unique capsid morphology that contains more prominent extensions of protein IX and can replicate efficiently in a phylogenetically diverse range of species. These findings, in addition to the recognition that both the genetic diversity of BtAdVs and the number of different bat species from disparate geographic regions infected with BtAdVs appears to be extensive, tentatively suggest that bats may have served as a potential reservoir for the cross-species transfer of adenoviruses to other hosts, as theorized for CAdV. Importance:
        
      
      Although many adenoviruses are host specific and likely codiverged with their hosts over millions of years, other adenoviruses appear to have emerged through successful cross-species transmission events on more recent time scales. The wide geographic distribution and genetic diversity of adenoviruses in bats and their close phylogenetic relationship to Canine mastadenovirus A (CAdV A) has raised important questions about how CAdV A, and possibly other mammalian adenoviruses, may have emerged. Although most adenoviruses tend to cause limited disease in their natural hosts, CAdV A is unusual in that it may cause high morbidity and sometimes fatal infections in immunocompetent hosts and is thus an important pathogen of carnivores. Here, we performed a comparative evolutionary and structural study of representative bat and canine adenoviruses to better understand the relationship between these two viral groups.","['1 Department of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', '2 Department of Computational and Systems Biology, Center for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', '3 Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA.', '4 Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, School of Life and Environmental Sciences and Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', '5 Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA aba25@vt.edu.', '6 Baker Institute for Animal Health, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.', '7 Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA.']","Nicole Hackenbrack, Matthew B Rogers, Robert E Ashley, M Kevin Keel, Steven V Kubiski, John A Bryan, Elodie Ghedin, Edward C Holmes, Susan L Hafenstein, Andrew B Allison, ",Journal of virology,2017,bat adenovirus; canine adenovirus; cross-species transmission; cryo-electron microscopy; host range; mastadenovirus; virus evolution.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27807242
323,Novel herpesviruses in neotropical bats and their relationship with other members of the Herpesviridae family,"In the past decade, a large number of studies have detected herpesvirus sequences from many bat species around the world. Nevertheless, the discovery of bat herpesviruses is geographically uneven. Of the various bat species tested to date, only a few were from the New World. Seeking to investigate the distribution and diversity of herpesviruses circulating in neotropical bats, we carried out molecular screening of 195 blood DNA samples from 11 species of three bat families (Phyllostomidae, Mormoopidae, and Molossidae). Using polymerase chain reaction amplification, with degenerate consensus primers targeting highly conserved amino acid motifs of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase and Glycoprotein B genes, we characterized novel viral sequences from all tested species. BLAST searches, pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, as well as phylogenetic analyses confirmed that they all belonged to the Herpesviridae family, of the Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. Fourteen partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, of which three beta- and 11 gamma-herpesviruses, were detected. A total of 12 partial Glycoprotein B gene sequences, all gamma-herpesviruses, were characterized. Every sequence was specific to a bat species and in some species (Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, and Pteronotus rubiginosus) multiple viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses of beta- and gammaherpesvirus sequences led to the identification of bat-specific clades. Those composed of sequences obtained from different bat species belonging to distinct subfamilies follow the taxonomy of bats. This study confirms the astonishing diversity of bat herpesviruses and broadens our knowledge of their host range. Nevertheless, it also emphasizes the fact that, to better appreciate the evolutionary history of these viruses, much remains to be done at various taxonomic levels.","['1 Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Université de la Guyane, Ecole doctorale 587 ""Diversités, Santé et Développement en Amazonie"", Cayenne, French Guiana.', '2 Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana.', '3 Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana; Université de la Guyane, Ecole doctorale 587 ""Diversités, Santé et Développement en Amazonie"", Cayenne, French Guiana; Département de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Unité de Biologie des Infections Virales Emergentes, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Institut Pasteur, Lyon, France.

324,Evolution and Diversity of Bat and Rodent Paramyxoviruses from North America,"Paramyxoviruses are a diverse group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of which several species cause significant mortality and morbidity. In recent years the collection of paramyxovirus sequences detected in wild mammals has substantially grown; however, little is known about paramyxovirus diversity in North American mammals. To better understand natural paramyxovirus diversity, host range, and host specificity, we sought to comprehensively characterize paramyxoviruses across a range of diverse cooccurring wild small mammals in southern Arizona. We used highly degenerate primers to screen fecal and urine samples and obtained a total of 55 paramyxovirus sequences from 12 rodent species and 6 bat species. We also performed Illumina transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and de novo assembly on 14 of the positive samples to recover a total of 5 near-full-length viral genomes. We show there are at least two clades of rodent-borne paramyxoviruses in Arizona, while bat-associated paramyxoviruses formed a putative single clade. Using structural homology modeling of the viral attachment protein, we infer that three of the five novel viruses likely bind sialic acid in a manner similar to other respiroviruses, while the other two viruses from heteromyid rodents likely bind a novel host receptor. We find no evidence for cross-species transmission, even among closely related sympatric host species. Taken together, these data suggest paramyxoviruses are a common viral infection in some bat and rodent species present in North America and illuminate the evolution of these viruses. IMPORTANCE There are a number of viral lineages that are potential zoonotic threats to humans. One of these, paramyxoviruses have jumped into humans multiple times from wild and domestic animals. We conducted one of the largest viral surveys of wild mammals in the United States to better understand paramyxovirus diversity and evolution.","['1 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', '2 Laboratory of Clinical and Evolutionary Virology, Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Transplantation, Rega Institute, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']","Brendan B Larsen, Sophie Gryseels, Hans W Otto, Michael Worobey, ",Journal of virology,2022,Paramyxovirus; codivergence; evolution; mammals.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34668771
325,Variable evolutionary routes to host establishment across repeated rabies virus host shifts among bats,"Determining the genetic pathways that viruses traverse to establish in new host species is crucial to predict the outcome of cross-species transmission but poorly understood for most host-virus systems. Using sequences encoding 78% of the rabies virus genome, we explored the extent, repeatability and dynamic outcome of evolution associated with multiple host shifts among New World bats. Episodic bursts of positive selection were detected in several viral proteins, including regions associated with host cell interaction and viral replication. Host shifts involved unique sets of substitutions, and few sites exhibited repeated evolution across adaptation to many bat species, suggesting diverse genetic determinants over host range. Combining these results with genetic reconstructions of the demographic histories of individual viral lineages revealed that although rabies viruses shared consistent three-stage processes of emergence in each new bat species, host shifts involving greater numbers of positively selected substitutions had longer delays between cross-species transmission and enzootic viral establishment. Our results point to multiple evolutionary routes to host establishment in a zoonotic RNA virus that may influence the speed of viral emergence.","['1 Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA. dstrike@uga.edu']","Daniel G Streicker, Sonia M Altizer, Andrés Velasco-Villa, Charles E Rupprecht, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2012,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23150575

A previously partially characterized CoV, Eptesicus bat CoV, was identified in 12 (6.9%) samples by nested RT-PCR. Six near-complete genomes were determined. Genetic analysis found a high similarity between all CoV-positive samples, Rocky Mountain bat CoV 65 and alphacoronavirus HCQD-2020 recently identified in South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis of genome sequences showed EbCoV is closely related to bat CoV HKU2 and swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV; however, topological incongruences were noted for the spike gene that was more closely related to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Similar to some alphaCoVs, a novel gene, ORF7, was discovered downstream of the nucleocapsid, whose protein lacked similarity to known proteins.

Phylogeographic analyses of RdRp sequences show that several CoVs strains circulate in European bats: (i) old strains detected that have probably diverged a long time ago and are detected in different bat subspecies; (ii) strains detected in Myotis and Pipistrellus bat species that have more recently diverged. Our findings support previous observations describing the complexity of the detected CoVs in bats worldwide.","[""1 Molecular &amp; Cellular Virology, University Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1019-UMR 8204-CIIL-Centre d'Infection et d'Immunité de Lille, Bâtiment IBL. 1 rue du Pr.

331,A new phylogenetic lineage of rabies virus associated with western pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus hesperus),"Bats represent the major source of human rabies cases in the New World. In the USA, most cases are associated with species that are not commonly found or reported rabid. To understand better the epidemiology and public health significance of potentially important bat species, a molecular study was performed on samples collected from naturally infected rabid western pipistrelle (Pipistrellus hesperus), eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) from different regions of their geographical distribution in the USA. A 264 bp fragment at the 5' end of the N gene coding region was sequenced and analysed in comparison with rabies virus variants circulating within other North American mammals. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that P. hesperus bats maintain a unique rabies virus variant. Preliminary data also suggest that P. subflavus and Lasionycteris noctivagans may harbour two different rabies virus variants (Ps and Ln) that are likely to be maintained independently by each bat species, which recently appear to have emerged as major vectors of human disease.","['1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DVRD/VRZB/Rabies, G33, 1600 Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', '2 1899 Olmo Way, Walnut Creek, CA 94598-1446, USA.', '3 Department of Biology and Center for Disease Ecology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.', '4 Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Health Services, 850 Marina Bay Parkway, Richmond, CA 94804-6403, USA.']","Richard Franka, Denny G Constantine, Ivan Kuzmin, Andres Velasco-Villa, Serena A Reeder, Daniel Streicker, Lillian A Orciari, Anna J Wong, Jesse D Blanton, Charles E Rupprecht, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16847127
332,Genome sequence analysis of Tamana bat virus and its relationship with the genus Flavivirus,"Tamana bat virus (TABV, isolated from the bat Pteronotus parnellii) is currently classified as a tentative species in the genus FLAVIVIRUS: We report here the determination and analysis of its complete coding sequence. Low but significant similarity scores between TABV and member-viruses of the genus Flavivirus were identified in the amino acid sequences of the structural, NS3 and NS5 genes. A series of cysteines located in the envelope protein and the most important enzymatic domains of the virus helicase/NTPase, methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were found to be highly conserved. In the serine-protease domain, the catalytic sites were conserved, but variations in sequence were found in the putative substrate-binding sites, implying possible differences in the protease specificity. In accordance with this finding, the putative cleavage sites of the TABV polyprotein by the virus protease are substantially different from those of flaviviruses. The phylogenetic position of TABV could not be determined precisely, probably due to the extremely significant genetic divergence from other member-viruses of the family FLAVIVIRIDAE: However, analysis based on both genetic distances and maximum-likelihood confirmed that TABV is more closely related to the flaviviruses than to the other genera. These findings have implications for the evolutionary history and taxonomic classification of the family as a whole: (i) the possibility that flaviviruses were derived from viruses infecting mammals rather than from mosquito viruses cannot be excluded; (ii) using the current criteria for the definition of genera in the family Flaviviridae, TABV should be assigned to a new genus.","['1 Unité des Virus Emergents, EA3292-IFR48, Université de la Méditerranée, Faculté de Médecine, 27 Bd J.

333,Molecular diversity and evolutionary history of rabies virus strains circulating in the Balkans,"Molecular studies of European classical rabies viruses (RABV) have revealed a number of geographically clustered lineages. To study the diversity of Balkan RABV, partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences were analysed from a unique panel of isolates (n = 210), collected from various hosts between 1972 and 2006. All of the Balkan isolates grouped within the European/Middle East Lineage, with the majority most closely related to East European strains. A number of RABV from Bosnia & Herzegovina and Montenegro, collected between 1986 and 2006, grouped with the West European strains, believed to be responsible for the rabies epizootic that spread throughout Europe in the latter half of the 20th Century. In contrast, no Serbian RABV belonged to this sublineage. However, a distinct group of Serbian fox RABV provided further evidence for the southwards wildlife-mediated movement of rabies from Hungary, Romania and Serbia into Bulgaria. To determine the optimal region for evolutionary analysis, partial, full and concatenated N-gene and glycoprotein (G) gene sequences were compared. Whilst both the divergence times and evolutionary rates were similar irrespective of genomic region, the 95 % highest probability density (HPD) limits were significantly reduced for full N-gene and concatenated NG-gene sequences compared with partial gene sequences. Bayesian coalescent analysis estimated the date of the most common recent ancestor of the Balkan RABV to be 1885 (95 % HPD, 1852-1913), and skyline plots suggested an expansion of the local viral population in 1980-1990, which coincides with the observed emergence of fox rabies in the region.","['1 National Centre for Zoonosis Research, University of Liverpool, Leahurst, Neston, South Wirral CH64 7TE, UK.', '2 Wildlife Zoonoses and Vector-borne Diseases Research Group, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 3NB, UK.', '3 Institute for Epidemiology, WHO Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research, OIE Reference Laboratory for Rabies, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Seestrasse 55, D-16868 Wusterhausen, Germany.', '4 Department for Microbiology, Pasteur Institute Novi Sad, Hajduk Veljkova 1, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia.']","L M McElhinney, D A Marston, C M Freuling, W Cragg, S Stankov, D Lalosević, V Lalosević, T Müller, A R Fooks, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21632560

336,"Genetic characterization of the first chiropteran papillomavirus, isolated from a basosquamous carcinoma in an Egyptian fruit bat: the Rousettus aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1","The complete genomic DNA of a novel papillomavirus (PV) was isolated from a basosquamous carcinoma on the wing of an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). Initial short sequences of the E1 and L1 genes of this virus were retrieved by PCR with degenerate papillomavirus-specific primers, and the entire R. aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1 (RaPV-1) DNA was then amplified by long template PCR, cloned and sequenced with a transposon insertion method. The RaPV-1 genome counts 7970 basepairs and contains the typical papillomavirus open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E6, E7, L1 and L2). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 open reading frames of RaPV-1 and 46 other human and animal papillomavirus type species, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis shows that RaPV-1 has a close-to-root position in the papillomavirus evolutionary tree. Since RaPV-1 is only distantly related to other papillomaviruses (with maximally 50% nucleotide sequence identity across the L1 open reading frame), it cannot be assigned to one of the existing papillomavirus genera and therefore represents the first member of a novel, as yet unnamed, close-to-root papillomavirus genus. This is the first time a papillomavirus has been isolated and characterized from a member of the Chiroptera order.","['1 Laboratory of Clinical & Epidemiological Virology, Rega Institute, University of Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, Leuven, Belgium. annabel.rector@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']","Annabel Rector, Sara Mostmans, Koenraad Van Doorslaer, Christy A McKnight, Roger K Maes, Annabel G Wise, Matti Kiupel, Marc Van Ranst, ",Veterinary microbiology,2006,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16854536
337,Interface between Bats and Pigs in Heavy Pig Production,"Bats are often claimed to be a major source for future viral epidemics, as they are associated with several viruses with zoonotic potential. Here we describe the presence and biodiversity of bats associated with intensive pig farms devoted to the production of heavy pigs in northern Italy. Since chiropters or signs of their presence were not found within animal shelters in our study area, we suggest that fecal viruses with high environmental resistance have the highest likelihood for spillover through indirect transmission. In turn, we investigated the circulation of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), coronaviruses (CoVs) and astroviruses (AstVs) in pigs and bats sharing the same environment. Results of our preliminary study did not show any bat virus in pigs suggesting that spillover from these animals is rare. However, several AstVs, CoVs and MRVs circulated undetected in pigs. Among those, one MRV was a reassortant strain carrying viral genes likely acquired from bats. On the other hand, we found a swine AstV and a MRV strain carrying swine genes in bat guano, indicating that viral exchange at the bat-pig interface might occur more frequently from pigs to bats rather than the other way around. Considering the indoor farming system as the most common system in the European Union (EU), preventive measures should focus on biosecurity rather than displacement of bats, which are protected throughout the EU and provide critical ecosystem services for rural settings.","[""1 Laboratory for Viral Emerging Zoonoses, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Viale dell'Università 10, 35020 Legnaro PD, Italy."", ""2 OIE Collaborating Centre for Diseases at the Animal/Human Interface, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), Viale dell'Università 10, 35020 Legnaro PD, Italy."", '3 Cooperativa S.T.E.R.N.A., Ecological STudies Research Nature Environment, Via Pedriali 12, 47100 Forlì, Italy.', '4 Laboratory for Viral Genomics and trascriptomics, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), 35020 Legnaro PD, Italy.', '5 Suivet, Via Ernesto Che Guevara 55, 42123 Reggio Emilia, Italy.', '6 Freelance Veterinarian, 33010 Pagnacco UD, Italy.', '7 Laboratory for Diagnostic Virology, Department of Animal Health, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), 35020 Legnaro PD, Italy.']","Stefania Leopardi, Pamela Priori, Barbara Zecchin, Gianpiero Zamperin, Adelaide Milani, Francesco Tonon, Mirco Giorgiutti, Maria Serena Beato, Paola De Benedictis, ",Viruses,2020,bats; pigs; reassortment; spillover; viruses.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33375071
338,"Bats, Primates, and the Evolutionary Origins and Diversification of Mammalian Gammaherpesviruses","Gammaherpesviruses (γHVs) are generally considered host specific and to have codiverged with their hosts over millions of years. This tenet is challenged here by broad-scale phylogenetic analysis of two viral genes using the largest sample of mammalian γHVs to date, integrating for the first time bat γHV sequences available from public repositories and newly generated viral sequences from two vampire bat species (Desmodus rotundus and Diphylla ecaudata). Bat and primate viruses frequently represented deep branches within the supported phylogenies and clustered among viruses from distantly related mammalian taxa. Following evolutionary scenario testing, we determined the number of host-switching and cospeciation events. Cross-species transmissions have occurred much more frequently than previously estimated, and most of the transmissions were attributable to bats and primates. We conclude that the evolution of the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily has been driven by both cross-species transmissions and subsequent cospeciation within specific viral lineages and that the bat and primate orders may have potentially acted as superspreaders to other mammalian taxa throughout evolutionary history. Importance:
        
      
      It has long been believed that herpesviruses have coevolved with their hosts and are species specific. Nevertheless, a global evolutionary analysis of bat viruses in the context of other mammalian viruses, which could put this widely accepted view to the test, had not been undertaken until now. We present two main findings that may challenge the current view of γHV evolution: multiple host-switching events were observed at a higher rate than previously appreciated, and bats and primates harbor a large diversity of γHVs which may have led to increased cross-species transmissions from these taxa to other mammals.","['1 Department of Wildlife Diseases, Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW), Berlin, Germany escalera@izw-berlin.de greenwood@izw-berlin.de.', '2 Centro Nacional de Investigación Disciplinaria en Microbiología Animal-INIFAP, Mexico City, Mexico.', '3 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA.', '4 Departamento de Genética del Desarrollo y Fisiología Molecular, Instituto de Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.', '5 Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Universidad Veracruzana, Veracruz, Mexico, and Institut für Virologie, Robert von Ostertag-Haus-Zentrum für Infektionsmedizin, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '6 Department of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']","Marina Escalera-Zamudio, Edith Rojas-Anaya, Sergios-Orestis Kolokotronis, Blanca Taboada, Elizabeth Loza-Rubio, Maria L Méndez-Ojeda, Carlos F Arias, Nikolaus Osterrieder, Alex D Greenwood, ",mBio,2016,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27834200
339,The molecular epidemiology of rabies associated with chiropteran hosts in Mexico,"While large-scale dog vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced urban rabies throughout Mexico, reports of sylvatic rabies, including cases of spill-over of bat strains into livestock and humans, are increasing. To improve knowledge of these epidemiological trends, 64 Mexican rabies virus isolates from various host species, have been characterized. Phylogenetic analysis at the viral P locus identified distinct viral strains associated with terrestrial reservoirs (dog, skunk and fox/bobcat) and a variant associated with the insectivorous bat, T. brasiliensis, consistent with prior reports. Of the two distinct clades of viruses associated with the vampire bat reservoir, one comprised just four specimens and formed an outlying group to all other vampire bat rabies isolates including those from South America and the Caribbean, a finding consistent with the early emergence of the vampire bat reservoir in Mexico. Antigenic variation of the vampire bat specimens did not correlate with the main genetic groupings; moreover complete N gene sequence analysis of selected specimens indicated limited variation within the encoded nucleoprotein that could form the basis of antigenic variation. A single isolate recovered from a cat represents a new viral variant not previously identified in North America that probably circulates in a species of insectivorous bat.","['1 Rabies Center of Expertise, Ottawa Laboratory - Fallowfield, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), 3851 Fallowfield Road, Ottawa, Ont., Canada K2H 8P9. nadindaviss@inspection.gc.ca']","Susan A Nadin-Davis, Elizabeth Loza-Rubio, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16303200
340,Isolation and Characterization of a Novel Gammaherpesvirus from a Microbat Cell Line,"While employing deep sequencing and de novo assembly to characterize the mRNA transcript profile of a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus, we serendipitously identified mRNAs encoding proteins with a high level of identity to herpesviruses. A majority were closely related to proteins of equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2), a horse gammaherpesvirus. We demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of herpesvirus-like particles in the microbat cells. Passage of supernatants from microbat cells to Vero cells resulted in syncytium formation, and expression of viral genes and amplification of viral DNA were demonstrated by quantitative PCR. Susceptibility of human cell lines to productive infection was also demonstrated. Next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kb with at least 77 open reading frames (ORFs), predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization. Phylogenic analysis of the envelope glycoprotein (gB) and DNA polymerase (POLD1) revealed similarity to multiple gammaherpesviruses, including those from as-yet-uncultured viruses of the Rhadinovirus genus that were obtained by deep sequencing of bat tissues. Moreover, the assembled genome revealed ORFs that share little or no homology to known ORFs in EHV-2 but are similar to accessory proteins of other gammaherpesviruses. Some also have striking homology to predicted Myotis bat proteins. Cumulatively, this study provides the first isolation and characterization of a replication-competent bat gammaherpesvirus. IMPORTANCE Bats are of significant interest as reservoirs for zoonotic viral pathogens; however, tools to dissect bat-virus interactions are limited in availability. This study serendipitously identified, in an established bat cell line, a fully replication-competent gammaherpesvirus; determined the complete genome sequence of the virus; and generated a viral transcript map. This virus can replicate in select human and nonhuman primate cell lines. However, analyses of viral sequences support a bat origin for this virus; we therefore refer to the virus as bat gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8). The viral genome contains unique open reading frames that likely encode modulators of bat innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways and expresses viral miRNAs. The virus and its gene products should provide a unique tool to dissect both bat and gammaherpesvirus biology.","['1 Virology Group, J.

The Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), due to its abundance, sanguivorous feeding habit involving humans and domestic animals, and highly social behavioral ecology, may have an unusually high potential for interspecies disease transmission. Previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in D. rotundus, yet the diversity of other viruses, bacteria, and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown. We screened 396 blood, urine, saliva, and fecal samples from D. rotundus captured in Guatemala for 13 viral families and genera. Positive results were found for rhabdovirus, adenovirus, and herpesvirus assays. We also screened these samples for Bartonella spp. and found that 38% of individuals tested positive. To characterize potential for interspecies transmission associated with feeding behavior, we also analyzed cytochrome B sequences from fecal samples to identify prey species and found that domestic cattle (Bos taurus) made up the majority of blood meals. Our findings suggest that the risk of pathogen spillover from Desmodus rotundus, including between domestic animal species, is possible and warrants further investigation to characterize this microbial diversity and expand our understanding of foraging ecology in their populations.","['1 Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', '2 EcoHealth Alliance, 460\xa0W. 34th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY, 11231, USA. olival@ecohealthalliance.org.', '3 Center for Health Studies, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', '4 Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', '5 EcoHealth Alliance, 460\xa0W. 34th Street, Suite 1701, New York, NY, 11231, USA.', '6 American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, USA.']","Amy K Wray, Kevin J Olival, David Morán, Maria Renee Lopez, Danilo Alvarez, Isamara Navarrete-Macias, Eliza Liang, Nancy B Simmons, W Ian Lipkin, Peter Daszak, Simon J Anthony, ",EcoHealth,NO_DATE,Bartonella; Chiroptera; adenovirus; bats; disease ecology; feeding preference; herpesvirus; pathogen discovery; rhabdovirus; viral.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27660213
342,Phylodynamics reveals extinction-recolonization dynamics underpin apparently endemic vampire bat rabies in Costa Rica,"Variation in disease incidence in wildlife is often assumed to reflect environmental or demographic changes acting on an endemic pathogen. However, apparent endemicity might instead arise from spatial processes that are challenging to identify from traditional data sources including time series and field studies. Here, we analysed longitudinal sequence data collected from rabies virus outbreaks over 14 years in Costa Rica, a Central American country that has recorded continuous vampire bat-transmitted rabies outbreaks in humans and livestock since 1985. We identified five phylogenetically distinct lineages which shared most recent common ancestors with viruses from North and South America. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions supported bidirectional viral dispersals involving countries to the north and south of Costa Rica at different time points. Within Costa Rica, viruses showed little contemporaneous spatial overlap and no lineage was detected across all years of surveillance. Statistical models suggested that lineage disappearances were more likely to be explained by viral extinctions than undetected viral circulation. Our results highlight the importance of international viral dispersal for shaping the burden of rabies in Costa Rica, suggest a Central American corridor of rabies virus invasions between continents, and show that apparent disease endemicity may arise through recurrent pathogen extinctions and reinvasions which can be readily detected in relatively small datasets by joining phylodynamic and modelling approaches.","['1 MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, UK.', '2 Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', '3 Laboratorio de Pruebas de Paternidad, Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social, San José, Costa Rica.', '4 Clínica Veterinaria Clivet, San José, Costa Rica.', '5 Laboratorio de Bioseguridad, Laboratorio Nacional de Servicios Veterinarios, Servicio Nacional de Salud Animal, Heredia, Costa Rica.', '6 Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']","Daniel G Streicker, Silvia Lucia Fallas González, Giovanna Luconi, Rocío González Barrientos, Bernal Leon, ",Proceedings.

344,Defining objective clusters for rabies virus sequences using affinity propagation clustering,"Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses, and is one of the oldest known zoonoses. In recent years, more than 21,000 nucleotide sequences of rabies viruses (RABV), from the prototype species rabies lyssavirus, have been deposited in public databases. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses in combination with metadata suggest geographic distributions of RABV. However, these analyses somewhat experience technical difficulties in defining verifiable criteria for cluster allocations in phylogenetic trees inviting for a more rational approach. Therefore, we applied a relatively new mathematical clustering algorythm named 'affinity propagation clustering' (AP) to propose a standardized sub-species classification utilizing full-genome RABV sequences. Because AP has the advantage that it is computationally fast and works for any meaningful measure of similarity between data samples, it has previously been applied successfully in bioinformatics, for analysis of microarray and gene expression data, however, cluster analysis of sequences is still in its infancy. Existing (516) and original (46) full genome RABV sequences were used to demonstrate the application of AP for RABV clustering. On a global scale, AP proposed four clusters, i.e. New World cluster, Arctic/Arctic-like, Cosmopolitan, and Asian as previously assigned by phylogenetic studies. By combining AP with established phylogenetic analyses, it is possible to resolve phylogenetic relationships between verifiably determined clusters and sequences.

345,Full genome characterization of two novel Alpha-coronavirus species from Italian bats,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been detected worldwide in several bat species, which are considered the main reservoir. The attention to the high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European countries.","['1 Department of Sciences, University Roma Tre, Viale Guglielmo Marconi 446, 00146, Rome, Italy; Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161, Rome, Italy.', '2 Department of Virology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna, Via Antonio Bianchi 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy.', '3 Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161, Rome, Italy.', '4 Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161, Rome, Italy.

346,A distinct lineage of influenza A virus from bats,"Influenza A virus reservoirs in animals have provided novel genetic elements leading to the emergence of global pandemics in humans. Most influenza A viruses circulate in waterfowl, but those that infect mammalian hosts are thought to pose the greatest risk for zoonotic spread to humans and the generation of pandemic or panzootic viruses. We have identified an influenza A virus from little yellow-shouldered bats captured at two locations in Guatemala. It is significantly divergent from known influenza A viruses. The HA of the bat virus was estimated to have diverged at roughly the same time as the known subtypes of HA and was designated as H17. The neuraminidase (NA) gene is highly divergent from all known influenza NAs, and the internal genes from the bat virus diverged from those of known influenza A viruses before the estimated divergence of the known influenza A internal gene lineages. Attempts to propagate this virus in cell cultures and chicken embryos were unsuccessful, suggesting distinct requirements compared with known influenza viruses. Despite its divergence from known influenza A viruses, the bat virus is compatible for genetic exchange with human influenza viruses in human cells, suggesting the potential capability for reassortment and contributions to new pandemic or panzootic influenza A viruses.","['1 Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. sot1@cdc.gov']","Suxiang Tong, Yan Li, Pierre Rivailler, Christina Conrardy, Danilo A Alvarez Castillo, Li-Mei Chen, Sergio Recuenco, James A Ellison, Charles T Davis, Ian A York, Amy S Turmelle, David Moran, Shannon Rogers, Mang Shi, Ying Tao, Michael R Weil, Kevin Tang, Lori A Rowe, Scott Sammons, Xiyan Xu, Michael Frace, Kim A Lindblade, Nancy J Cox, Larry J Anderson, Charles E Rupprecht, Ruben O Donis, ",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2012,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22371588
347,"Characterization of Durham virus, a novel rhabdovirus that encodes both a C and SH protein","The family Rhabdoviridae is a diverse group of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses that are distributed worldwide and infect a wide range of hosts including vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Of the 114 currently recognized vertebrate rhabdoviruses, relatively few have been well characterized at both the antigenic and genetic level; hence, the phylogenetic relationships between many of the vertebrate rhabdoviruses remain unknown. The present report describes a novel rhabdovirus isolated from the brain of a moribund American coot (Fulica americana) that exhibited neurological signs when found in Durham County, North Carolina, in 2005. Antigenic characterization of the virus revealed that it was serologically unrelated to 68 other known vertebrate rhabdoviruses. Genomic sequencing of the virus indicated that it shared the highest identity to Tupaia rhabdovirus (TUPV), and as only previously observed in TUPV, the genome encoded a putative C protein in an overlapping open reading frame (ORF) of the phosphoprotein gene and a small hydrophobic (SH) protein located in a novel ORF between the matrix and glycoprotein genes. Phylogenetic analysis of partial amino acid sequences of the nucleoprotein and polymerase protein indicated that, in addition to TUPV, the virus was most closely related to avian and small mammal rhabdoviruses from Africa and North America. In this report, we present the morphological, pathological, antigenic, and genetic characterization of the new virus, tentatively named Durham virus (DURV), and discuss its potential evolutionary relationship to other vertebrate rhabdoviruses.","['1 Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, United States. allisona@uga.edu']","A B Allison, G Palacios, A Travassos da Rosa, V L Popov, L Lu, S Y Xiao, K DeToy, T Briese, W I Lipkin, M K Keel, D E Stallknecht, G R Bishop, R B Tesh, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20863863
348,Coevolutionary Analysis Implicates Toll-Like Receptor 9 in Papillomavirus Restriction,"Upon infection, DNA viruses can be sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to the activation of type I and III interferons to block infection. Therefore, viruses must inhibit these signaling pathways, avoid being detected, or both. Papillomavirus virions are trafficked from early endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and wait for the onset of mitosis to complete nuclear entry. This unique subcellular trafficking strategy avoids detection by cytoplasmic PRRs, a property that may contribute to the establishment of infection. However, as the capsid uncoats within acidic endosomal compartments, the viral DNA may be exposed to detection by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). In this study, we characterized two new papillomaviruses from bats and used molecular archeology to demonstrate that their genomes altered their nucleotide compositions to avoid detection by TLR9, providing evidence that TLR9 acts as a PRR during papillomavirus infection. Furthermore, we showed that TLR9, like other components of the innate immune system, is under evolutionary selection in bats, providing the first direct evidence for coevolution between papillomaviruses and their hosts. Finally, we demonstrated that the cancer-associated human papillomaviruses show a reduction in CpG dinucleotides within a TLR9 recognition complex. IMPORTANCE Viruses must avoid detection by the innate immune system.

349,Host phylogeny constrains cross-species emergence and establishment of rabies virus in bats,"For RNA viruses, rapid viral evolution and the biological similarity of closely related host species have been proposed as key determinants of the occurrence and long-term outcome of cross-species transmission. Using a data set of hundreds of rabies viruses sampled from 23 North American bat species, we present a general framework to quantify per capita rates of cross-species transmission and reconstruct historical patterns of viral establishment in new host species using molecular sequence data. These estimates demonstrate diminishing frequencies of both cross-species transmission and host shifts with increasing phylogenetic distance between bat species. Evolutionary constraints on viral host range indicate that host species barriers may trump the intrinsic mutability of RNA viruses in determining the fate of emerging host-virus interactions.","['1 Rabies Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. dstrike@uga.edu']","Daniel G Streicker, Amy S Turmelle, Maarten J Vonhof, Ivan V Kuzmin, Gary F McCracken, Charles E Rupprecht, ","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2010,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20689015
350,Alphacoronavirus in a Daubenton's Myotis Bat ( Myotis daubentonii) in Sweden,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated a search for reservoirs and species potentially involved in back and forth transmission. Studies have postulated bats as one of the key reservoirs of coronaviruses (CoVs), and different CoVs have been detected in bats. So far, CoVs have not been found in bats in Sweden and we therefore tested whether they carry CoVs. In summer 2020, we sampled a total of 77 adult bats comprising 74 Myotis daubentonii, 2 Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and 1 M. mystacinus bats in southern Sweden. Blood, saliva and feces were sampled, processed and subjected to a virus next-generation sequencing target enrichment protocol. An Alphacoronavirus was detected and sequenced from feces of a M. daubentonii adult female bat. Phylogenetic analysis of the almost complete virus genome revealed a close relationship with Finnish and Danish strains. This was the first finding of a CoV in bats in Sweden, and bats may play a role in the transmission cycle of CoVs in Sweden. Focused and targeted surveillance of CoVs in bats is warranted, with consideration of potential conflicts between public health and nature conservation required as many bat species in Europe are threatened and protected.","['1 Department of Clinical Microbiology, Umeå University, 901 85 Umea, Sweden.', '2 Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Environmental Studies, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, 901 83 Umea, Sweden.', '3 Swedish Biodiversity Centre (CBM), Department of Urban and Rural Development, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, 750 07 Uppsala, Sweden.', '4 Division of CBRN Defence and Security, Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI, 906 21 Umea, Sweden.']","Olivia Wesula Lwande, Therese Thalin, Johnny de Jong, Andreas Sjödin, Jonas Näslund, Magnus Evander, Frauke Ecke, ",Viruses,2022,Myotis daubentonii; Pipistrellus pygmaeus; Sweden; bats; coronavirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35336963

353,SARS-CoV related Betacoronavirus and diverse Alphacoronavirus members found in western old-world,"The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, triggered the discovery of a high diversity of coronaviruses in bats. Studies from Europe have shown that coronaviruses circulate in bats in France but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity. In the current study the diversity of coronaviruses circulating in western Europe was extensively explored. Ten alphacoronaviruses in eleven bat species belonging to the Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families and, a SARS-CoV-related Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were identified. The diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses presently reported from western Europe is much higher than previously described and includes a SARS-CoV sister group. This diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species. That said, the identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus, and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location. The observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the same species in Europe and Asia, emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution in this group.","[""1 Institut Pasteur, Unité Environnement et Risques Infectieux, CIBU, Infection et Epidemiologie, 75015, Paris, France; Normandie Université, EA2656, Groupe de Recherche sur l'Adaptation Microbienne, 14000, Caen, France.

Close to 350 samples originating from 28 bat species (17 from Germany, 27 from Hungary) were screened for the presence of adenoviruses (AdVs) using a nested PCR that targets the DNA polymerase gene of AdVs. An additional PCR was designed and applied to amplify a fragment from the gene encoding the IVa2 protein of mastadenoviruses. All German samples originated from organs of bats found moribund or dead. The Hungarian samples were excrements collected from colonies of known bat species, throat or rectal swab samples, taken from live individuals that had been captured for faunistic surveys and migration studies, as well as internal organs of dead specimens. Overall, 51 samples (14.73%) were found positive. We detected 28 seemingly novel and six previously described bat AdVs by sequencing the PCR products. The positivity rate was the highest among the guano samples of bat colonies. In phylogeny reconstructions, the AdVs detected in bats clustered roughly, but not perfectly, according to the hosts' families (Vespertilionidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Phyllostomidae and Pteropodidae). In a few cases, identical sequences were derived from animals of closely related species. On the other hand, some bat species proved to harbour more than one type of AdV. The high prevalence of infection and the large number of chiropteran species worldwide make us hypothesise that hundreds of different yet unknown AdV types might circulate in bats.","['1 Institute for Veterinary Medical Research, Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences , Hungária krt. 21, H-1143 Budapest , Hungary.', '2 Robert Koch Institute, Centre for Biological Threats and Special Pathogens , Berlin , Germany.', '3 Aggtelek National Park Directorate , Jósvafő , Hungary.', '4 Department of Zoology, Hungarian Natural History Museum , Budapest , Hungary.', '5 Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research , Berlin , Germany.']","Márton Vidovszky, Claudia Kohl, Sándor Boldogh, Tamás Görföl, Gudrun Wibbelt, Andreas Kurth, Balázs Harrach, ",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,NO_DATE,Molecular virology; adenovirus; bat viruses; phylogeny.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26599097

364,Full-Genome Sequences of Alphacoronaviruses and Astroviruses from Myotis and Pipistrelle Bats in Denmark,"Bat species worldwide are receiving increased attention for the discovery of emerging viruses, cross-species transmission, and zoonoses, as well as for characterizing virus infections specific to bats. In a previous study, we investigated the presence of coronaviruses in faecal samples from bats at different locations in Denmark, and made phylogenies based on short, partial ORF1b sequences. In this study, selected samples containing bat coronaviruses from three different bat species were analysed, using a non-targeted approach of next-generation sequencing. From the resulting metagenomics data, we assembled full-genome sequences of seven distinct alphacoronaviruses, three astroviruses, and a polyomavirus, as well as partial genome sequences of rotavirus H and caliciviruses, from the different bat species. Comparisons to published sequences indicate that the bat alphacoronaviruses belong to three different subgenera-i.e., Pedacovirus, Nyctacovirus, and Myotacovirus-that the astroviruses may be new species in the genus Mamastrovirus, and that the polyomavirus could also be a new species, but unassigned to a genus. Furthermore, several viruses of invertebrates-including two Rhopalosiphum padi (aphid) viruses and a Kadipiro virus-present in the faecal material were assembled. Interestingly, this is the first detection in Europe of a Kadipiro virus.","['1 Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', '2 Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 1870 Frederiksberg, Denmark.', '3 Department of Virus and Microbiological Special Diagnostics, Statens Serum Institut, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark.']","Christina M Lazov, Graham J Belsham, Anette Bøtner, Thomas Bruun Rasmussen, ",Viruses,2021,RNA viruses; insect viruses; virus excretion; virus taxonomy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34199948
365,First cases of European bat lyssavirus type 1 in Iberian serotine bats: Implications for the molecular epidemiology of bat rabies in Europe,"Previous studies have shown that EBLV-1 strains exclusively hosted by Eptesicus isabellinus bats in the Iberian Peninsula cluster in a specific monophyletic group that is related to the EBLV-1b lineage found in the rest of Europe. More recently, enhanced passive surveillance has allowed the detection of the first EBLV-1 strains associated to Eptesicus serotinus south of the Pyrenees. The aim of this study is the reconstruction of the EBLV-1 phylogeny and phylodynamics in the Iberian Peninsula in the context of the European continent. We have sequenced 23 EBLV-1 strains detected on nine E. serotinus and 14 E. isabellinus. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the first 400-bp-5' fragment of the Nucleoprotein (N) gene together with other 162 sequences from Europe. Besides, fragments of the variable region of the phosphoprotein (P) gene and the glycoprotein-polymerase (G-L) intergenic region were studied on Spanish samples. Phylogenies show that two of the new EBLV-1a strains from Iberian E. serotinus clustered together with French strains from the North of the Pyrenees, suggesting a recent expansion southwards of this subtype. The remaining seven Iberian strains from E. serotinus grouped, instead, within the cluster linked, so far, to E. isabellinus, indicating that spatial distribution prevails over species specificity in explaining rabies distribution and supporting interspecific transmission. The structure found within the Iberian Peninsula for EBLV-1b is in concordance with that described previously for E. isabellinus. Finally, we have found that the current EBLV-1 European strains could have emerged only 175 years ago according to our evolutionary dynamics analyses.","['1 National Center for Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Centre de Fauna Salvatge de Torreferrussa, Catalan Wildlife Service, Direcció General de Medi Natural-Forestal Catalana, Santa Perpètua de la Mogoda, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', '3 Estación Biológica de Doñana, CSIC, Sevilla, Andalusia, Spain.', '4 CIBER de Epidemiología y Salud Pública, CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain.']","Patricia Mingo-Casas, Virginia Sandonís, Elena Obón, José M Berciano, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Javier Juste, Juan E Echevarría, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29684025

367,Comparative analysis of the full genome sequence of European bat lyssavirus type 1 and type 2 with other lyssaviruses and evidence for a conserved transcription termination and polyadenylation motif in the G-L 3' non-translated region,"We report the first full-length genomic sequences for European bat lyssavirus type-1 (EBLV-1) and type-2 (EBLV-2). The EBLV-1 genomic sequence was derived from a virus isolated from a serotine bat in Hamburg, Germany, in 1968 and the EBLV-2 sequence was derived from a virus isolate from a human case of rabies that occurred in Scotland in 2002. A long-distance PCR strategy was used to amplify the open reading frames (ORFs), followed by standard and modified RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) techniques to amplify the 3' and 5' ends. The lengths of each complete viral genome for EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 were 11 966 and 11 930 base pairs, respectively, and follow the standard rhabdovirus genome organization of five viral proteins. Comparison with other lyssavirus sequences demonstrates variation in degrees of homology, with the genomic termini showing a high degree of complementarity. The nucleoprotein was the most conserved, both intra- and intergenotypically, followed by the polymerase (L), matrix and glyco- proteins, with the phosphoprotein being the most variable. In addition, we have shown that the two EBLVs utilize a conserved transcription termination and polyadenylation (TTP) motif, approximately 50 nt upstream of the L gene start codon. All available lyssavirus sequences to date, with the exception of Pasteur virus (PV) and PV-derived isolates, use the second TTP site. This observation may explain differences in pathogenicity between lyssavirus strains, dependent on the length of the untranslated region, which might affect transcriptional activity and RNA stability.","['1 Rabies & Wildlife Zoonoses Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA, Weybridge), WHO Collaborating Centre for the Characterisation of Rabies and Rabies-Related Viruses, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT15 3NB, UK.', '2 Institute for Epidemiology, WHO Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research, OIE Reference Laboratory for Rabies, Friedrich Loeffler Institute - Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Seestrasse 55, D-16868 Wusterhausen, Germany.', '3 Max-von-Pettenkofer Institute and Gene Center, Feodor-Lynen-Str. 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.', '4 Unité Stratégies Antivirales, Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Docteur Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']","D A Marston, L M McElhinney, N Johnson, T Müller, K K Conzelmann, N Tordo, A R Fooks, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17374776

Issyk-Kul virus, a member of the family Nairoviridae, was first isolated in the 1970s from vespertilionid bats in Central Asia. Issyk-Kul virus has been described as human-pathogenic virus, causing febrile outbreaks in humans with headaches, myalgia and nausea.

369,Identification of Novel Betaherpesviruses in Iberian Bats Reveals Parallel Evolution,"A thorough search for bat herpesviruses was carried out in oropharyngeal samples taken from most of the bat species present in the Iberian Peninsula from the Vespertilionidae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae and Rhinolophidae families, in addition to a colony of captive fruit bats from the Pteropodidae family. By using two degenerate consensus PCR methods targeting two conserved genes, distinct and previously unrecognized bat-hosted herpesviruses were identified for the most of the tested species. All together a total of 42 potentially novel bat herpesviruses were partially characterized. Thirty-two of them were tentatively assigned to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily while the remaining 10 were allocated into the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. Significant diversity was observed among the novel sequences when compared with type herpesvirus species of the ICTV-approved genera. The inferred phylogenetic relationships showed that most of the betaherpesviruses sequences fell into a well-supported unique monophyletic clade and support the recognition of a new betaherpesvirus genus. This clade is subdivided into three major clades, corresponding to the families of bats studied. This supports the hypothesis of a species-specific parallel evolution process between the potentially new betaherpesviruses and their bat hosts. Interestingly, two of the betaherpesviruses' sequences detected in rhinolophid bats clustered together apart from the rest, closely related to viruses that belong to the Roseolovirus genus. This suggests a putative third roseolo lineage. On the contrary, no phylogenetic structure was detected among several potentially novel bat-hosted gammaherpesviruses found in the study. Remarkably, all of the possible novel bat herpesviruses described in this study are linked to a unique bat species.","['1 Virology Section, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', '2 Estación Biológica de Doñana, CSIC, Seville, Spain.', '3 Centro de Investigación Biológica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', '4 Department of Zoology and Animal Cell Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, The Basque Country, Spain.']","Francisco Pozo, Javier Juste, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Carolina Aznar-López, Carlos Ibáñez, Inazio Garin, Joxerra Aihartza, Inmaculada Casas, Antonio Tenorio, Juan Emilio Echevarría, ",PloS one,2016,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28036408

371,Novel paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats,"The zoonotic potential of paramyxoviruses is particularly demonstrated by their broad host range like the highly pathogenic Hendra and Nipah viruses originating from bats. But while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats. Moreover, we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results. Organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in Germany and tested for paramyxovirus RNA in parallel to a histo-pathological examination. Nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected, two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus Jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus Rubulavirus. Two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys, suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with Hendra virus.Our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus-host co-evolution in European bats. Since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera Rubulavirus and Jeilongvirus, a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other Microchiroptera compared to Megachiroptera can be assumed. Given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use, a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in Europe needs to be considered.","['1 Robert Koch Institute, Centre for Biological Security, Berlin, Germany.

372,First encounter of European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) in a bat in Finland,"In Finland, rabies in bats was suspected for the first time in 1985 when a bat researcher, who had multiple bat bites, died in Helsinki. The virus isolated from the researcher proved to be antigenically related to rabies viruses previously detected in German bats. Later, the virus was typed as EBLV-2b. Despite an epidemiological study in bats 1986 and subsequent rabies surveillance, rabies in bats was not detected in Finland until the first case in a Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) was confirmed in August 2009. The bat was paralysed, occasionally crying, and biting when approached; it subsequently tested positive for rabies. The virus was genetically typed as EBLV-2. This is the northernmost case of bat rabies ever detected in Europe. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the EBLV-2b isolate from the human case in 1985 and the isolate from the bat in 2009 were genetically closely related, demonstrating that EBLV-2 may have been circulating in Finland for many years.","['1 Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira, Helsinki, Finland. miia.jakava-viljanen@evira.fi']","M Jakava-Viljanen, T Lilley, E-M Kyheröinen, A Huovilainen, ",Epidemiology and infection,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20196902
373,First detection of European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) in Norway,"Background:
        
      
      In Europe, bat rabies is primarily attributed to European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) and European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) which are both strongly host-specific. Approximately thirty cases of infection with EBLV-2 in Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) and pond bats (M. dasycneme) have been reported. Two human cases of rabies caused by EBLV-2 have also been confirmed during the last thirty years, while natural spill-over to other non-flying mammals has never been reported. Rabies has never been diagnosed in mainland Norway previously. Case presentation:
        
      
      In late September 2015, a subadult male Daubenton's bat was found in a poor condition 800 m above sea level in the southern part of Norway. The bat was brought to the national Bat Care Centre where it eventually displayed signs of neurological disease and died after two days. EBLV-2 was detected in brain tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing of a part of the nucleoprotein gene, and lyssavirus was isolated in neuroblastoma cells. Conclusions:
        
      
      The detection of EBLV-2 in a bat in Norway broadens the knowledge on the occurrence of this zoonotic agent. Since Norway is considered free of rabies, adequate information to the general public regarding the possibility of human cases of bat-associated rabies should be given. No extensive surveillance of lyssavirus infections in bats has been conducted in the country, and a passive surveillance network to assess rabies prevalence and bat epidemiology is highly desired.","['1 Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Postbox 750, Sentrum, 0106, Oslo, Norway. torfinn.moldal@vetinst.no.', '2 Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Postbox 750, Sentrum, 0106, Oslo, Norway.', '3 Nancy OIE/WHO/EU Laboratory for Rabies and Wildlife, French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety, CS 40009, 54220, Malzéville, France.', '4 Animal and Plant Health Agency, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey, KT15 3NB, UK.', ""5 Norwegian Zoological Society's Bat Care Centre, Rudsteinveien 67, 1480, Slattum, Norway.""]","Torfinn Moldal, Turid Vikøren, Florence Cliquet, Denise A Marston, Jeroen van der Kooij, Knut Madslien, Irene Ørpetveit, ",BMC veterinary research,2017,Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii); European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2); Rabies; fluorescent antibody test (FAT); polymerase chain reaction (PCR); rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28693578

375,Investigating antibody neutralization of lyssaviruses using lentiviral pseudotypes: a cross-species comparison,"Cross-neutralization between rabies virus (RABV) and two European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV-1 and -2) was analysed using lentiviral pseudotypes as antigen vectors. Glycoprotein (G-protein) cDNA from RABV challenge virus standard-11 (CVS-11) and EBLV-1 and -2 were cloned and co-expressed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol and packageable green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter genes in human cells. The harvested lentiviral (HIV) vector infected over 40% of baby hamster kidney (BHK) target cells, providing high-titre pseudotype stocks. Tests on blinded antibody-positive (n=15) and -negative (n=45) sera, predetermined by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Office International des Epizooties (OIE), revealed that the CVS-11 pseudotype assay had 100% concordance with FAVN and strongly correlated with neutralization titres (r2=0.89). Cross-neutralization tests using sera from RABV-vaccinated humans and animals on pseudotypes with CVS-11, EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 envelopes showed that the relative neutralization titres correlated broadly with the degree of G-protein diversity. Pseudotypes have three major advantages over live-virus neutralization tests: (i) they can be handled in low-biohazard-level laboratories; (ii) the use of reporter genes such as GFP or beta-galactosidase will allow the assay to be undertaken at low cost in laboratories worldwide; (iii) each assay requires <10 microl serum. This robust microassay will improve our understanding of the protective humoral immunity that current rabies vaccines confer against emerging lyssaviruses, and will be applicable to surveillance studies, thus helping to control the spread of rabies.","['1 MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, 46 Cleveland Street, London W1T 4JF, UK.', '2 Rabies and Wildlife Zoonoses Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge), WHO Collaborating Centre for the Characterisation of Rabies and Rabies-related Viruses, New Haw, Addlestone KT15 3NB, UK.']","Edward Wright, Nigel J Temperton, Denise A Marston, Lorraine M McElhinney, Anthony R Fooks, Robin A Weiss, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18753230
376,Hypsugopoxvirus: A Novel Poxvirus Isolated from Hypsugo savii in Italy,"Interest in bat-related viruses has increased considerably during the last decade, leading to the discovery of a rising number of new viruses in several bat species. Poxviridae are a large, diverse family of DNA viruses that can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. To date, only a few documented detections of poxviruses have been described in bat populations on three different continents (America, Africa, and Australia). These viruses are phylogenetically dissimilar and have diverse clinical impacts on their hosts. Herein, we report the isolation, nearly complete genome sequencing, and annotation of a novel poxvirus detected from an insectivorous bat (Hypsugo savii) in Northern Italy. The virus is tentatively named Hypsugopoxvirus (HYPV) after the bat species from which it was isolated. The nearly complete genome size is 166,600 nt and it encodes 161 genes. Genome analyses suggest that HYPV belongs to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, with the highest nucleotide identity (85%) to Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) detected from a microbat Eptesicus fuscus in WA, USA, in 2011. To date, HYPV represents the first poxvirus detected in bats in Europe; thus, its viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated further.","[""1 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. davide.lelli@izsler.it."", ""2 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. antonio.lavazza@izsler.it."", ""3 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. alice.prosperi@izsler.it."", ""4 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. enrica.sozzi@izsler.it."", ""5 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. francesca.faccin@izsler.it."", ""6 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. laura.baioni@izsler.it."", ""7 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. tiziana.trogu@izsler.it."", '8 Wildlife Rehabilitation Center WWF of Valpredina via Pioda n.1, 24060 Cenate Sopra (BG), Italy. clivetorzi@gmail.com.', '9 Wildlife Rehabilitation Center WWF of Valpredina via Pioda n.1, 24060 Cenate Sopra (BG), Italy. info@oasivalpredina.it.', '10 Wildlife Rehabilitation Center WWF of Valpredina via Pioda n.1, 24060 Cenate Sopra (BG), Italy. pipistrelli@valpredina.eu.', ""11 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. chiara.chiapponi@izsler.it."", ""12 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. anamaria.morenomartin@izsler.it.""]","Davide Lelli, Antonio Lavazza, Alice Prosperi, Enrica Sozzi, Francesca Faccin, Laura Baioni, Tiziana Trogu, Gian Luca Cavallari, Matteo Mauri, Anna Maria Gibellini, Chiara Chiapponi, Ana Moreno, ",Viruses,2019,Italy; bats; poxvirus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31248065

378,Molecular epidemiology of bat lyssaviruses in Europe,"Bat rabies cases in Europe are principally attributed to two lyssaviruses, namely European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) and European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2). Between 1977 and 2011, 961 cases of bat rabies were reported to Rabies Bulletin Europe, with the vast majority (>97%) being attributed to EBLV-1. There have been 25 suspected cases of EBLV-2, of which 22 have been confirmed. In addition, two single isolations of unique lyssaviruses from European insectivorous bats were reported in south-west Russia in 2002 (West Caucasian bat virus) and in Germany in 2010 (Bokeloh bat lyssavirus). In this review, we present phylogenetic analyses of the EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 using partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. In particular, we have analysed all EBLV-2 cases for which viral sequences (N gene, 400 nucleotides) are available (n = 21). Oropharyngeal swabs collected from two healthy Myotis daubentonii during active surveillance programmes in Scotland and Switzerland also yielded viral RNA (EBLV-2). Despite the relatively low number of EBLV-2 cases, a surprisingly large amount of anomalous data has been published in the scientific literature and Genbank, which we have collated and clarified. For both viruses, geographical relationships are clearly defined on the phylogenetic analysis. Whilst there is no clear chronological clustering for either virus, there is some evidence for host specific relationships, particularly for EBLV-1 where more host variation has been observed. Further genomic regions must be studied, in particular for EBLV-1 isolates from Spain and the EBLV-2 isolates to provide support for the existence of sublineages.","['1 Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK. lorraine.mcelhinney@ahvla.gsi.gov.uk']","L M McElhinney, D A Marston, S Leech, C M Freuling, W H M van der Poel, J Echevarria, S Vázquez-Moron, D L Horton, T Müller, A R Fooks, ",Zoonoses and public health,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22937876
379,Detection and phylogenetic characterization of astroviruses in insectivorous bats from Central-Southern Italy,"In recent years, bats have been found to harbour many viruses, raising several questions about their role as reservoirs and potential disseminators of zoonotic viruses. We investigated the presence of six virus families in bats in three regions of Central-Southern Italy. Astroviruses were identified in seven of 13 bat species. Sequence analysis revealed marked genetic heterogeneity among the astroviruses identified, with nucleotide identity ranging between 60.26% and 87.62%. Astrovirus diversity was not associated with the bat species, the geographic areas or the bat colony, suggesting the circulation of several astrovirus strains in Italian ecosystems. Genetic diversification and interspecies transmission appear common in bat astroviruses and could provide, potentially, the bases for transmission to humans and other mammals. Yet overemphasizing this risk might have detrimental consequences for bat conservation and preservation of the important ecosystem services bats provide.","['1 Unit of Virology, Department of Animal Health, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, Portici, Naples, Italy.', '2 Wildlife Research Unit, Department of Agriculture, University of Naples Federico II, Portici, Naples, Italy.', '3 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Bari, Italy.', '4 Forestry and Conservation, Cassino, Frosinone, Italy.']","Maria Grazia Amoroso, Danilo Russo, Gianvito Lanave, Luca Cistrone, Annamaria Pratelli, Vito Martella, Giorgio Galiero, Nicola Decaro, Giovanna Fusco, ",Zoonoses and public health,NO_DATE,astrovirus; insectivorous bats; phylogenetic analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29896884
380,First Detection of Bat Astroviruses (BtAstVs) among Bats in Poland: The Genetic BtAstVs Diversity Reveals Multiple Co-Infection of Bats with Different Strains,"Background:
        
      
      Astroviruses (AstVs) are common pathogens of a wide range of animal hosts, including mammals and avians, causing gastrointestinal diseases, mainly gastroenteritis and diarrhea. They prompt a significant health problem in newborns and young children and economic losses in the poultry sector and mink farms. Recent studies revealed a growing number of bat species carrying astroviruses with a noticeable prevalence and diversity. Here, we demonstrate the first detection of bat astroviruses (BtAstVs) circulating in the population of insectivorous bats in the territory of Poland. Results:
        
      
      Genetically diverse BtAstVs (n = 18) were found with a varying degree of bat species specificity in five out of 15 bat species in Poland previously recognized as BtAstV hosts. Astroviral RNA was found in 12 out of 98 (12.2%, 95% CI 7.1-20.2) bat intestines, six bat kidneys (6.1%, 95% CI 2.8-12.7) and two bat livers (2.0%, 95% CI 0.4-7.1). Deep sequencing of the astroviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region revealed co-infections in five single bat individuals with highly distinct astrovirus strains. Conclusions:
        
      
      The detection of highly distinct bat astroviruses in Polish bats favors virus recombination and the generation of novel divergent AstVs and creates a potential risk of virus transmission to domestic animals and humans in the country. These findings provide a new insight into molecular epidemiology, prevalence of astroviruses in European bat populations and the risk of interspecies transmission to other animals including humans.","['1 Department of Virology, National Veterinary Research Institute, Al.

382,First isolation of EBLV-2 in Germany,"In Europe, rabies in bats is caused by European Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV) type 1 (EBLV-1) or type 2 (EBLV-2) which form two distinct genotypes (gt 5 and 6) within the genus Lyssavirus of the family of Rhadoviridae. Spill-over infections of EBLV in humans have caused fatal rabies encephalitis and highlighted the relevance of this wildlife disease for public health. The vast majority of the 831 European bat rabies cases reported between 1977 and 2006 were identified as EBLV-1. Only few virus isolates originating from Switzerland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were characterized as EBLV-2. Here we report the first EBLV-2 case detected in Germany in a Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) in August 2007. The bat showed clinical signs of disorders of the central nervous system and subsequently tested positive for rabies. The virus was isolated and characterized as EBLV-2 based on its antigen pattern and by nucleotide sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis indicated an association to EBLV-2 isolates from Switzerland which correlates with the origin of the bat close to the Swiss border.","['1 Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, WHO Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research, 16868 Wusterhausen, Germany.

The sequences of six bat GHV were similarly related to members of the gammaherpesvirus genera Percavirus and Rhadinovirus. The seventh GHV was related to the porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus 1 (genus Macavirus). The betaherpesvirus appeared to be a distant relative of human cytomegalovirus. For three bat GHV a 3.6 kbp locus was amplified and sequenced, spanning part of the glycoprotein B gene and the majority of the DPOL gene. In phylogenetic analysis, the three bat GHV formed a separate clade with similar distance to the Percavirus and Rhadinovirus clades. These novel viruses are the first herpesviruses to be described in bats.","['1 Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Wildlife Diseases - Pathology, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.']","Gudrun Wibbelt, Andreas Kurth, Nezlisah Yasmum, Michael Bannert, Sabine Nagel, Andreas Nitsche, Bernhard Ehlers, ",The Journal of general virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17872515

In concordance with Denmark and the Netherlands, Germany has reported one of the highest numbers (n = 187) of European bat lyssavirus (EBLV)-positive cases in bats in Europe so far (1954-2005). A combined descriptive epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis on bat rabies and prevailing EBLVs is presented, comprising the past 50 years. So far, only the two lineages of EBLV-1 (genotype 5), a and b, have been detected. Although only 50% of the rabies-positive bats have been identified by species, the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) is the bat species most frequently infected. Single rabies cases have also been detected in a further five indigenous bat species. There is proven evidence for a substantial bias in the frequency of bat rabies cases in the north of Germany, with an endemic cluster in the northwesternmost low-lying plain areas adjacent to the Netherlands and Denmark. Improvements to bat rabies surveillance and research are discussed.","['1 Institute for Epidemiology, WHO Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research, OIE Reference Laboratory for Rabies, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Wusterhausen, Germany. thomas.mueller@fli.bund.de']","T Müller, N Johnson, C M Freuling, A R Fooks, T Selhorst, A Vos, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17066249
385,Genetic polymorphism in the rabies virus nucleoprotein gene,"In an attempt to compare intrinsic and extrinsic genetic diversity of the lyssavirus genotypes, 69 rabies virus isolates from various part of the world were partially sequenced and compared to 13 representative isolates of the 6 lyssavirus genotypes. The analysis of their phylogenetic relationships, performed on the complete nucleoprotein (N) coding gene (1350 bases), established that the rabies virus isolates all belonged to genotype 1 and that at least 11 phylogenetic lineages could be identified in accordance with their geographical localization and species of origin. These lineages diverged mostly by the accumulation of synonymous mutations. Stabilizing selection, possibly related to host specificity, limits amino acid sequence and antigenic drift. Analyses were also performed either on the highly variable 400-base region coding for the amino terminus of the N protein or on the 93-base noncoding region corresponding to the 3' end of the N mRNA, the intergenic N-phosphoprotein (M1) region, and the 5' end of the M1 mRNA. These shorter nucleotide sequences were shown to provide phylogenetic data suitable for the completion of large epidemiological studies, but with less robustness. This latter noncoding sequence, despite a 3.1 times higher mutation rate than its adjacent coding N gene, followed a parallel evolutionary pattern.","['1 Unité de la Rage, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']","B Kissi, N Tordo, H Bourhy, ",Virology,1995,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7778285

The bat showed neurological signs and was later found dead. The laboratory analysis revealed the presence of lyssavirus, and the virus was characterized as EBLV-2. This isolation of EBLV-2 was the second time that the virus has been detected in a Daubenton's bat in Finland.

387,Evolutionary trends of European bat lyssavirus type 2 including genetic characterization of Finnish strains of human and bat origin 24 years apart,"Among other Lyssaviruses, Daubenton's and pond-bat-related European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) can cause human rabies. To investigate the diversity and evolutionary trends of EBLV-2, complete genome sequences of two Finnish isolates were analysed. One originated from a human case in 1985, and the other originated from a bat in 2009. The overall nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence identity of the two Finnish isolates were high, as well as the similarity to fully sequenced EBLV-2 strains originating from the UK and the Netherlands. In phylogenetic analysis, the EBLV-2 strains formed a monophyletic group that was separate from other bat-type lyssaviruses, with significant support. EBLV-2 shared the most recent common ancestry with Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) and Khujan virus (KHUV). EBLV-2 showed limited diversity compared to RABV and appears to be well adapted to its host bat species. The slow tempo of viral evolution was evident in the estimations of divergence times for EBLV-2: the current diversity was estimated to have built up during the last 2000 years, and EBLV-2 diverged from KHUV about 8000 years ago. In a phylogenetic tree of partial N gene sequences, the Finnish EBLV-2 strains clustered with strains from Central Europe, supporting the hypothesis that EBLV-2 circulating in Finland might have a Central European origin. The Finnish EBLV-2 strains and a Swiss strain were estimated to have diverged from other EBLV-2 strains during the last 1000 years, and the two Finnish strains appear to have evolved from a common ancestor during the last 200 years.","['Erratum to: Evolutionary trends of European bat lyssavirus type 2 including genetic characterization of Finnish strains of human and bat origin 24 years apart.\n      \n    \n\nJakava-Viljanen M, Nokireki T, Sironen T, Vapalahti O, Sihvonen L, Huovilainen A.\nJakava-Viljanen M, et al.\nArch Virol. 2015 Jul;160(7):1875. doi: 10.1007/s00705-015-2475-2.\nArch Virol. 2015.\nPMID: 26041725\nFree PMC article.\nNo abstract available.']","Miia Jakava-Viljanen, Tiina Nokireki, Tarja Sironen, Olli Vapalahti, Liisa Sihvonen, Anita Huovilainen, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25877913
388,Surveillance for European bat lyssavirus in Swiss bats,"Most countries in Western Europe are currently free of rabies in terrestrial mammals. Nevertheless, rabies remains a residual risk to public health due to the natural circulation of bat-specific viruses, such as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs). European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) are widely distributed throughout Europe, but little is known of their true prevalence and epidemiology. We report that only three out of 837 brains taken from bats submitted to the Swiss Rabies Centre between 1976 and 2009 were found by immunofluorescence (FAT) to be positive for EBLVs. All three positive cases were in Myotis daubentoni, from 1992, 1993 and 2002. In addition to this passive surveillance, we undertook a targeted survey in 2009, aimed at detecting lyssaviruses in live bats in Switzerland. A total of 237 bats of the species M. daubentoni, Myotis myotis, Eptesicus serotinus and Nyctalus noctula were captured at different sites in western Switzerland. Oropharyngeal swabs and blood from each individual were analysed by RT-PCR and rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), respectively. RNA corresponding to EBLV-2 was detected from oropharyngeal swabs of a single M. daubentoni bat, but no infectious virus was found. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the corresponding sequence was closely related to the other EBLV-2 sequences identified in previous rabies isolates from Swiss bats (particularly to that found at Geneva in 2002). Three M. daubentoni bats were found to be seropositive by RFFIT. In conclusion, even though the prevalence is low in Switzerland, continuous management and surveillance are required to assess the potential risk to public health.","['1 Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne, Le Biophore, Lausanne, Switzerland.']","A Megali, G Yannic, M-L Zahno, D Brügger, G Bertoni, P Christe, R Zanoni, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20803042
389,Enhanced passive bat rabies surveillance in indigenous bat species from Germany--a retrospective study,"In Germany, rabies in bats is a notifiable zoonotic disease, which is caused by European bat lyssaviruses type 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and 2), and the recently discovered new lyssavirus species Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV). As the understanding of bat rabies in insectivorous bat species is limited, in addition to routine bat rabies diagnosis, an enhanced passive surveillance study, i.e. the retrospective investigation of dead bats that had not been tested for rabies, was initiated in 1998 to study the distribution, abundance and epidemiology of lyssavirus infections in bats from Germany. A total number of 5478 individuals representing 21 bat species within two families were included in this study. The Noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula) and the Common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) represented the most specimens submitted. Of all investigated bats, 1.17% tested positive for lyssaviruses using the fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The vast majority of positive cases was identified as EBLV-1, predominately associated with the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus). However, rabies cases in other species, i.e. Nathusius' pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus nathusii), P. pipistrellus and Brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) were also characterized as EBLV-1. In contrast, EBLV-2 was isolated from three Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii). These three cases contribute significantly to the understanding of EBLV-2 infections in Germany as only one case had been reported prior to this study. This enhanced passive surveillance indicated that besides known reservoir species, further bat species are affected by lyssavirus infections. Given the increasing diversity of lyssaviruses and bats as reservoir host species worldwide, lyssavirus positive specimens, i.e. both bat and virus need to be confirmed by molecular techniques.","['1 Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, WHO Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research, Greifswald - Insel Riems, Germany.', '2 Arbeitskreis Fledermäuse Bodensee-Oberschwaben, Naturschutzbund Deutschland e.V., Überlingen, Germany.', '3 Wildlife Zoonoses and Vector Borne Diseases Research Group, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), Weybridge, Surrey, United Kingdom.', '4 Naturschutzbund Saarland e.V., Arbeitsgemeinschaft Fledermausschutz, Perl-Kesslingen, Germany.', '5 Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.', '6 Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '7 University of Potsdam, Department of Animal Ecology, Potsdam, Germany.', '8 Biosphärenreservat Karstlandschaft Südharz, Landesreferenzstelle für Fledermausschutz Sachsen-Anhalt, Roβla, Germany.', '9 Niedersächsischer Landesbetrieb für Wasserwirtschaft, Küsten- und Naturschutz, Hannover, Germany.', '10 Interessengemeinschaft für Fledermausschutz und -forschung in Thüringen e.V., Schweina, Germany.', '11 Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Greifswald - Insel Riems, Germany.', '12 Staatliche Vogelschutzwarte für Hessen, Rheinland-Pfalz und Saarland, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', '13 Landesamt für Umwelt, Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz Land Brandenburg, Naturschutzstation Zippelsförde, Zippelsförde, Germany.', '14 Leibniz-Institute for Zoo- und Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany.']","Juliane Schatz, Conrad Martin Freuling, Ernst Auer, Hooman Goharriz, Christine Harbusch, Nicholas Johnson, Ingrid Kaipf, Thomas Christoph Mettenleiter, Kristin Mühldorfer, Ralf-Udo Mühle, Bernd Ohlendorf, Bärbel Pott-Dörfer, Julia Prüger, Hanan Sheikh Ali, Dagmar Stiefel, Jens Teubner, Rainer Günter Ulrich, Gudrun Wibbelt, Thomas Müller, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2014,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24784117

      With the advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, the ability to generate large amounts of sequence data has revolutionized the genomics field. Most RNA viruses have relatively small genomes in comparison to other organisms and as such, would appear to be an obvious success story for the use of NGS technologies. However, due to the relatively low abundance of viral RNA in relation to host RNA, RNA viruses have proved relatively difficult to sequence using NGS technologies. Here we detail a simple, robust methodology, without the use of ultra-centrifugation, filtration or viral enrichment protocols, to prepare RNA from diagnostic clinical tissue samples, cell monolayers and tissue culture supernatant, for subsequent sequencing on the Roche 454 platform. Results:
        
      
      As representative RNA viruses, full genome sequence was successfully obtained from known lyssaviruses belonging to recognized species and a novel lyssavirus species using these protocols and assembling the reads using de novo algorithms. Furthermore, genome sequences were generated from considerably less than 200 ng RNA, indicating that manufacturers' minimum template guidance is conservative. In addition to obtaining genome consensus sequence, a high proportion of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were identified in the majority of samples analyzed. Conclusions:

Faecal samples and dead individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they were morphologically identified as reoviruses by negative staining electron microscopy observation. The definitive assignment of all isolates to MRV was confirmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene. Through a multiplex RT-PCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of 19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416 bp) and complete S1 (1416 bp) sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the three serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D and 419E) were highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identification of MRV type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the need for vigilance.","[""1 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, IZSLER, Brescia, Italy. davide.lelli@izsler.it""]","D Lelli, A Moreno, A Lavazza, M Bresaola, E Canelli, M B Boniotti, P Cordioli, ",Zoonoses and public health,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22931153

Short hairpin RNAs targeting Capsid, NS2B and NS4B genes were cloned into pSilencer 3.1-H1 neo and designated as pshCapsid, pshNS2B and pshNS4B, respectively. Vero cells that were positively transfected were selected for creating stable cell lines expressing shRNAs constitutively. These cells were subjected to West Nile virus at multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 10. The cells stably transfected with pshCapsid gave the best silencing effect among the three stable cell lines (transfected with pshCapsid, pshNS2B and pshNS4B) at both 12- and 24 h p.i. When compared to the non-transfected WNV-infected cells, pshCapsid stably transfected cells showed more than 4 log(10) unit reduction in viral transcripts and greater than 3 log(10) unit reduction in virus production. Cells stably transfected with pshNS2B did not exhibit as strong an inhibition when compared to the pshCapsid stably transfected cells having only 2 log(10) unit reduction in virus titre. The pshNS4B-stably transfected cells did not suppress WNV replication. Hence, from this study, pshCapsid has the potential to be developed into effective antiviral strategy for WNV infection.","['1 Flavivirology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, 5 Science Drive 2, National University of Singapore, 117597 Singapore, Singapore.']","S P Ong, J J H Chu, M L Ng, ",Virus research,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18514349

In September 2002, a Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) found in Lancashire developed abnormal behaviour, including unprovoked aggression, while it was in captivity. Brain samples from the bat were tested for virus of the Lyssavirus genus, which includes EBLV-2 (genotype 6), and classical rabies virus (genotype 1). A positive fluorescent antibody test confirmed that it was infected with a lyssavirus, and PCR and genomic sequencing identified the virus as an EBLV-2a. Phylogenetic comparisons with all the published sequences from genotype 6 showed that it was closely related to the previous isolate of EBLV-2 in the UK and suggested links to isolates from bats in The Netherlands. The isolation of EBLV-2 from a bat found on the west coast of England provides evidence that this virus may be present within the UK Daubenton's bat population at a low prevalence level.","['1 Rabies Research and Diagnostic Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, New Haw, Addlestone, Surrey KT75 3NB.']","N Johnson, D Selden, G Parsons, D Healy, S M Brookes, L M McElhinney, A M Hutson, A R Fooks, ",The Veterinary record,2003,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696703
395,Isolation and characterization of three mammalian orthoreoviruses from European bats,"In recent years novel human respiratory disease agents have been described in South East Asia and Australia. The causative pathogens were classified as pteropine orthoreoviruses with strong phylogenetic relationship to orthoreoviruses of flying foxes inhabiting these regions. Subsequently, a zoonotic bat-to-human transmission has been assumed. We report the isolation of three novel mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) from European bats, comprising bat-borne orthoreovirus outside of South East Asia and Australia and moreover detected in insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera). MRVs are well known to infect a broad range of mammals including man. Although they are associated with rather mild and clinically unapparent infections in their hosts, there is growing evidence of their ability to also induce more severe illness in dogs and man. In this study, eight out of 120 vespertilionid bats proved to be infected with one out of three novel MRV isolates, with a distinct organ tropism for the intestine. One isolate was analyzed by 454 genome sequencing. The obtained strain T3/Bat/Germany/342/08 had closest phylogenetic relationship to MRV strain T3D/04, isolated from a dog. These novel reoviruses provide a rare chance of gaining insight into possible transmission events and of tracing the evolution of bat viruses.","['1 Robert Koch Institute, Centre for Biological Security 1, Berlin, Germany.

396,A preliminary study of viral metagenomics of French bat species in contact with humans: identification of new mammalian viruses,"The prediction of viral zoonosis epidemics has become a major public health issue. A profound understanding of the viral population in key animal species acting as reservoirs represents an important step towards this goal. Bats harbor diverse viruses, some of which are of particular interest because they cause severe human diseases. However, little is known about the diversity of the global population of viruses found in bats (virome). We determined the viral diversity of five different French insectivorous bat species (nine specimens in total) in close contact with humans. Sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing with Illumina technology and a dedicated bioinformatics analysis pipeline were used on pooled tissues (brain, liver and lungs). Comparisons of the sequences of contigs and unassembled reads provided a global taxonomic distribution of virus-related sequences for each sample, highlighting differences both within and between bat species. Many viral families were present in these viromes, including viruses known to infect bacteria, plants/fungi, insects or vertebrates, the most relevant being those infecting mammals (Retroviridae, Herpesviridae, Bunyaviridae, Poxviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Bornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae). In particular, we detected several new mammalian viruses, including rotaviruses, gammaretroviruses, bornaviruses and bunyaviruses with the identification of the first bat nairovirus. These observations demonstrate that bats naturally harbor viruses from many different families, most of which infect mammals. They may therefore constitute a major reservoir of viral diversity that should be analyzed carefully, to determine the role played by bats in the spread of zoonotic viral infections.","['1 Institut Pasteur, Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation Unit, National Reference Centre for Rabies, WHO Reference Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Paris, France.', '2 Institut Pasteur, Genotyping of Pathogens and Public Health Platform, Paris, France.', '3 Institut Pasteur, Computer Center for Biology, Paris, France.']","Laurent Dacheux, Minerva Cervantes-Gonzalez, Ghislaine Guigon, Jean-Michel Thiberge, Mathias Vandenbogaert, Corinne Maufrais, Valérie Caro, Hervé Bourhy, ",PloS one,2014,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24489870
397,New Adenovirus Groups in Western Palaearctic Bats,"In the context of long-term screening for viruses on Western Palaearctic bats, we tested for the presence of adenovirus 1392 oropharyngeal swabs and 325 stool samples taken from 27 bat species. Adenoviruses were detected in 12 species of the Vespertilionidae and the Rhinolophidae families. Fifty positive respiratory and 26 positive stool samples were studied. Phylogenetic analyses of partial hexon protein and partial DNA-dependent DNA polymerase genes indicate that all these bat adenoviruses belong to the genus Mastadenovirus but without constituting a monophyletic cluster. According to genetic identities, the new groups are distinct to the previously described Bat mastadenovirus A and B species and contribute with potentially new members. Our data support that diversity of bat mastadenovirus is host-dependent and increase the knowledge of potentially pathogenic virus from bats. Due to the active role of bats as viral reservoirs, the characterization of these viruses is relevant for Public Health.","['1 Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Carretera de Majadahonda-Pozuelo km 2.

398,Detection and full genome characterization of two beta CoV viruses related to Middle East respiratory syndrome from bats in Italy,"Background:
        
      
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which belongs to beta group of coronavirus, can infect multiple host species and causes severe diseases in humans. Multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. In this study, we describe the detection and full genome characterization of two CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV from two Italian bats, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii. Methods:
        
      
      Pool of viscera were tested by a pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Virus isolation was attempted by inoculation in different cell lines. Full genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent platform and phylogenetic trees were performed using IQtree software. Similarity plots of CoV clade c genomes were generated by using SSE v1.2. The three dimensional macromolecular structure (3DMMS) of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank (PDB). Results:
        
      
      Both samples resulted positive to the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR (IT-batCoVs) and their genome organization showed identical pattern of MERS CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic group placed in the Beta2c clade formed by MERS-CoV sequences originating from humans and camels and bat-related sequences from Africa, Italy and China. The comparison of the secondary and 3DMMS of the RBD of IT-batCoVs with MERS, HKU4 and HKU5 bat sequences showed two aa deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD in IT-batCoV and HKU5 RBDs. Conclusions:
        
      
      This study reported two beta CoVs closely related to MERS that were obtained from two bats belonging to two commonly recorded species in Italy (P. kuhlii and H. savii). The analysis of the RBD showed similar structure in IT-batCoVs and HKU5 respect to HKU4 sequences. Since the RBD domain of HKU4 but not HKU5 can bind to the human DPP4 receptor for MERS-CoV, it is possible to suggest also for IT-batCoVs the absence of DPP4-binding potential. More surveillance studies are needed to better investigate the potential intermediate hosts that may play a role in the interspecies transmission of known and currently unknown coronaviruses with particular attention to the S protein and the receptor specificity and binding affinity.","['1 Department of Virology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna, Via Antonio Bianchi 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy. anamaria.morenomartin@izsler.it.', '2 Department of Virology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna, Via Antonio Bianchi 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy.', '3 Department of Food Safety, Istituto Superiore di Sanità.

399,Development of broad-spectrum human monoclonal antibodies for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis,"Currently available rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for use in humans includes equine or human rabies immunoglobulins (RIG). The replacement of RIG with an equally or more potent and safer product is strongly encouraged due to the high costs and limited availability of existing RIG. In this study, we identified two broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies that represent a valid and affordable alternative to RIG in rabies PEP. Memory B cells from four selected vaccinated donors were immortalized and monoclonal antibodies were tested for neutralizing activity and epitope specificity. Two antibodies, identified as RVC20 and RVC58 (binding to antigenic site I and III, respectively), were selected for their potency and broad-spectrum reactivity. In vitro, RVC20 and RVC58 were able to neutralize all 35 rabies virus (RABV) and 25 non-RABV lyssaviruses. They showed higher potency and breath compared to antibodies under clinical development (namely CR57, CR4098, and RAB1) and commercially available human RIG. In vivo, the RVC20-RVC58 cocktail protected Syrian hamsters from a lethal RABV challenge and did not affect the endogenous hamster post-vaccination antibody response.","['1 FAO and National Reference Centre for Rabies, National Reference Centre and OIE Collaborating Centre for Diseases at the Animal-Human Interface, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Legnaro, Padua, Italy.', '2 Humabs BioMed SA, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', '3 Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', '4 Institut Pasteur, Unit of Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation National Reference Centre for Rabies World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rabies, Paris Cedex 15, France.', '5 Viral Pseudotype Unit, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, London, UK.', '6 Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, UK.', '7 Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland Institute of Microbiology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', '8 Humabs BioMed SA, Bellinzona, Switzerland Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Università della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland davide.corti@humabs.ch.']","Paola De Benedictis, Andrea Minola, Elena Rota Nodari, Roberta Aiello, Barbara Zecchin, Angela Salomoni, Mathilde Foglierini, Gloria Agatic, Fabrizia Vanzetta, Rachel Lavenir, Anthony Lepelletier, Emma Bentley, Robin Weiss, Giovanni Cattoli, Ilaria Capua, Federica Sallusto, Edward Wright, Antonio Lanzavecchia, Hervé Bourhy, Davide Corti, ",EMBO molecular medicine,2016,human monoclonal antibody; lyssaviruses; post‐exposure prophylaxis; rabies.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992832

In the present study we report the first molecular data and genomic characterization of a novel picornavirus from the bat species M. schreibersii in Europe. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the novel bat picornaviruses unambiguously belong to the Mischivirus genus and were highly divergent from other bat-derived picornaviruses of the Sapelovirus genus.

Phylogenetic analysis conducted on TOSV genome demonstrated the co-circulation of two major lineages in the Mediterranean areas, TOSV A and TOSV B. This study reports the results of the genetic analysis of 32 viral strains isolated in Italy in the last 30 years from patients hospitalized with neurological disease, from sandflies and from the brain of a bat. The genetic diversity of TOSV was investigated by determining the sequences of the whole S segment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TOSV A lineage represents the lineage circulating in Italy. Moreover, the current variability of lineage A is similar to that of lineage B.","['1 Department of Infectious, Parasitic and Immune-Mediated Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.

403,Detection of coronavirus in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in southern Brazil,"The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.","['1 Laboratório de Virologia, Faculdade de Veterinária, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil.', '2 Laboratório de Microbiologia Molecular, Instituto de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Feevale, Novo Hamburgo, Brazil.', '3 Secretaria Estadual de Agricultura, Pecuária e Desenvolvimento Rural (SEAPDR), Rio Grande do Sul Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', '4 Centro de Pesquisa em Saúde Animal, Instituto de Pesquisas Veterinárias Desidério Finamor (IPVDF), Departamento de Diagnóstico e Pesquisa Agropecuária (DDPA), Secretaria da Agricultura, Pecuária e Desenvolvimento Rural (SEAPDR), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.']","Raquel Silva Alves, Juliana do Canto Olegário, Matheus Nunes Weber, Mariana Soares da Silva, Raissa Canova, Jéssica Tatiane Sauthier, Letícia Ferreira Baumbach, André Alberto Witt, Ana Paula Muterle Varela, Fabiana Quoos Mayer, Renata da Fontoura Budaszewski, Cláudio Wageck Canal, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,NO_DATE,Bat; Coronavirus; Desmodus rotundus; PCR; sequencing.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33977671

We identified and sequenced a novel sarbecovirus (RhGB01) from a British horseshoe bat, at the western extreme of the rhinolophid range. Our results extend both the geographic and species ranges of sarbecoviruses and suggest their presence throughout the horseshoe bat distribution. Within the spike protein receptor binding domain, but excluding the receptor binding motif, RhGB01 has a 77% (SARS-CoV-2) and 81% (SARS-CoV) amino acid homology. While apparently lacking hACE2 binding ability, and hence unlikely to be zoonotic without mutation, RhGB01 presents opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecovirus homologous recombination. Our findings highlight that the natural distribution of sarbecoviruses and opportunities for recombination through intermediate host co-infection are underestimated. Preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to bats is critical with the current global mass vaccination campaign against this virus.","['1 National Infection Service, Public Health England, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK.', '2 NIHR Health Protection Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7TX, UK.', '3 Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Conservation, School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK.', '4 Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Oxford University, Oxford, UK.', '5 Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, London, NW1 4RY, UK. a.cunningham@ioz.ac.uk.']","Jack M Crook, Ivana Murphy, Daniel P Carter, Steven T Pullan, Miles Carroll, Richard Vipond, Andrew A Cunningham, Diana Bell, ",Scientific reports,2021,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34282196

Bats have been recognized as potential reservoirs of novel viruses, with some viruses being regarded as a possible zoonotic threat to humans. In this study, we report the detection and analysis of adenoviruses from different bat species in northern Italy. Upon sequence and phylogenetic analysis, based on a short diagnostic fragment of the highly-conserved DNA polymerase gene, we identified potential novel candidate adenovirus species, including an avian-like adenovirus strain. An adenovirus isolate was obtained in simian cell lines from the carcass of a Pipistrellus kuhlii, and the complete genome sequence was reconstructed using deep sequencing technologies. The virus displayed high nucleotide identity and virtually the same genome organization as the Pipistrellus pipistrellus strain PPV1, isolated in Germany in 2007.

The genomes of the BR-DR1 and BR-AL1 had 11,923 and 11,922 nt, respectively, and both encoded the five standard genes of rhabdoviruses. The complete nucleotide sequence identity between the BR-DR1 and BR-AL1 isolates was 97%. The BR-DR1 and BR-AL1 isolates had some conserved functional sites revealed by the fixed isolates, whereas both isolates had unique amino acid substitutions in the antigenic region IV of the nucleocapsid gene. Therefore, it is speculated that both isolates were nearly identical in virologic character. According to our phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genomes, both isolates belonged to genotype 1, and to the previously defined ""vampire bat-related RABV lineage"" which consisted of mainly D. rotundus- and A. lituratus-isolates; however, a branch pattern with high bootstrap values suggested that BR-DR1 was more closely related to the 9001FRA isolate, which was collected from a dog bitten by a bat in French Guiana, than to BR-AL1. This result suggests that the vampire bat-related RABV lineage includes Brazilian vampire bat and Brazilian frugivorous bat RABV and is further divided into Brazilian vampire bat and Brazilian frugivorous bat RABV sub-lineages. The phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genomes was valuable in discriminating among very closely related isolates.","['1 Nihon University Veterinary Research Center, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252–0880, Japan.']","Nobuyuki Mochizuki, Yuki Kobayashi, Go Sato, Shinji Hirano, Takuya Itou, Fumio H Ito, Takeo Sakai, ",The Journal of veterinary medical science,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21301181
411,Novel Alphacoronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses Cocirculate with Type 1 and Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS)-Related Betacoronaviruses in Synanthropic Bats of Luxembourg,"Several infectious disease outbreaks with high mortality in humans have been attributed to viruses that are thought to have evolved from bat viruses. In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species barrier after a host adaptation process.IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species barrier.","['1 Infectious Diseases Research Unit, Department of Infection and Immunity, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg maude.pauly@lih.lu.', ""2 Section Zoologie des Vertébrés, Centre de Recherche Scientifique, Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, Luxembourg, Luxembourg."", '3 Infectious Diseases Research Unit, Department of Infection and Immunity, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.']","Maude Pauly, Jacques B Pir, Catherine Loesch, Aurélie Sausy, Chantal J Snoeck, Judith M Hübschen, Claude P Muller, ",Applied and environmental microbiology,2017,Chiroptera; Luxembourg; coronavirus; molecular epidemiology; paramyxovirus; phylogenetic analysis; surveillance studies; virology; zoonotic infections.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28710271

Since they were reported as the probable source of spillover of highly pathogenic CoV into the human population, investigating the circulation of this virus in bats around the world became of great importance. We analyzed samples from 103 bats from two distinct regions in Brazil. Coronavirus from the Alphacoronavirus genus was detected in 12 animals, 11 from São José do Rio Preto-SP region and 1 from Barreiras-BA region, resulting in a prevalence of 17.18% and 2.56% respectively. The virus was detected not only in intestines but also in lungs and liver.

413,Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy,"Background:
        
      
      Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. Results:
        
      
      Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3-16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. Conclusions:
        
      
      This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.","[""1 Istituto zooprofilattico sperimentale del Piemonte, Liguria e Valle d'Aosta, Via Bologna 148, 10148, Torino, Italy. francesca.rizzo@izsto.it."", '2 Robert Koch Institute, Seestraße 10, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', '3 Chirosphera, via Tetti Barbiere 11, 10026, Santena, TO, Italy.', ""4 Istituto zooprofilattico sperimentale del Piemonte, Liguria e Valle d'Aosta, Via Bologna 148, 10148, Torino, Italy."", '5 Department of Veterinary Science, Largo Paolo Braccini 2, 10095, Grugliasco, TO, Italy.']","Francesca Rizzo, Kathryn M Edenborough, Roberto Toffoli, Paola Culasso, Simona Zoppi, Alessandro Dondo, Serena Robetto, Sergio Rosati, Angelika Lander, Andreas Kurth, Riccardo Orusa, Luigi Bertolotti, Maria Lucia Mandola, ",BMC veterinary research,2017,Bat-borne viruses; Coronavirus; Emerging viruses; Genetic characterization; Paramyxovirus; Surveillance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29273042

However, they also serve as natural reservoir for other virus groups with important evolutionary relevance and yet unknown zoonotic potential. We performed viral metagenomic analyses on Miniopterus schreibersii bat fecal samples. As a result, a novel parvovirus was detected for the first time in European bats. Although, bufavirus was recently discovered as a novel human infecting parvovirus, here we report sequence data of the first bufavirus from European bats related to human bufaviruses.

416,High genetic diversity of alphacoronaviruses in bat species (Mammalia: Chiroptera) from the Atlantic Forest in Brazil,"Bat coronaviruses (Bat-CoVs) represent around 35% of all virus genomes described in bats. Brazil has one of the highest mammal species diversity, with 181 species of bats described so far. However, few Bat-CoV surveillance programmes were carried out in the country. Thus, our aim was to jevaluate the Bat-CoV diversity in the Atlantic Forest, the second biome with the highest number of bat species in Brazil. We analysed 456 oral and rectal swabs and 22 tissue samples from Atlantic Forest bats, detecting Alphacoronavirus in 44 swab samples (9.6%) targeting the RdRp gene from seven different bat species, three of which have never been described as Bat-CoV hosts. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid (aa) sequences coding the RdRp gene grouped the sequences obtained in our study with Bat-CoV previously detected in identical or congeneric bat species, belonging to four subgenera, with high aa identity (over 90%). The RdRp gene was also detected in three tissue samples from Diphylla ecaudata and Sturnira lilium, and the partial S gene was successfully sequenced in five tissues and swab samples of D. ecaudata. The phylogenetic analysis based on the partial S gene obtained here grouped the sequence of D. ecaudata with CoV from Desmodus rotundus previously detected in Peru and Brazil, belonging to the Amalacovirus subgenus, with aa identity ranging from 73.6% to 88.8%. Our data reinforce the wide distribution of Coronaviruses in bats from Brazil and the novelty of three bats species as Bat-CoV hosts and the co-circulation of four Alphacoronavirus subgenera in Brazil.","['1 Department of Veterinary Medicine, FZEA-USP, University of Sao Paulo, Pirassununga, Brazil.', '2 Graduate Program in Experimental Epidemiology Applied to Zoonoses, FMVZ-USP, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', '3 Institute of Biomedical Science, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.', '4 Biological Museum, Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.', '5 Department of Biology, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', '6 School of Sea, Science and Technology, University of Vale do Itajaí, Itajaí, Brazil.', '7 Brusque Educational Foundation, Brusque, Brazil.', '8 Department of Genetics, Evolution and Bioagents, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', '9 Zoological Studies Laboratory, Federal University of Pernambuco Agreste, Garanhuns, Brazil.']","Larissa Mayumi Bueno, Laís Santos Rizotto, Amanda de Oliveira Viana, Laura Morais Nascimento Silva, Maria Vitória Dos Santos de Moraes, Julia Cristina Benassi, Guilherme Pereira Scagion, Erick Gustavo Dorlass, Bruna Larotonda Telezynski Lopes, Irineu Noberto Cunha, Ramiro Melinski, Igor Ferreira de Alvarenga, Gabriel Lins Leitão, Roberta Costa Rodrigues, Iolanda Maria da Silva Pereira, Lilia D'ark Nunes Dos Santos, Fabiane Fisch, Alana Drielle Rocha, Dagoberto Port, Gabriela Stahelin Pereira, Alessandra Greatti, Ana Caroline de Souza Barnabé, Junko Tsukamoto, Erika Hingst-Zaher, Severino Mendes de Azevedo Jr, Wallace Rodrigues Telino Jr, Joaquim Olinto Branco, Tatiana Ometto, Jansen de Araujo, Clarice Weis Arns, Helena Lage Ferreira, Edison Luiz Durigon, ",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022,RdRg gene; S gene; coronavirus; virus surveillance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35729863

In recent years, novel circular ssDNA genomes have recently been detected in a variety of fecal and environmental samples using deep sequencing approaches. In this study the identification of genomes of novel circoviruses and cycloviruses in feces of insectivorous bats is reported. Pan-reactive primers were used targeting the conserved rep region of circoviruses and cycloviruses to screen DNA bat fecal samples. Using this approach, partial rep sequences were detected which formed five phylogenetic groups distributed among the Circovirus and the recently proposed Cyclovirus genera of the Circoviridae. Further analysis using inverse PCR and Sanger sequencing led to the characterization of four new putative members of the family Circoviridae with genome size ranging from 1,608 to 1,790 nt, two inversely arranged ORFs, and canonical nonamer sequences atop a stem loop.","['1 Virology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Institute of Basic Health Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil.', '2 Virology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Institute of Basic Health Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil; FEPAGRO Animal Health, Institute of Veterinary Research ""Desidério Finamor"" (IPVDF), Eldorado do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil.', '3 FEPAGRO Animal Health, Institute of Veterinary Research ""Desidério Finamor"" (IPVDF), Eldorado do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil.', '4 Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, California, United States of America; University of California, Department of Laboratory Medicine, San Francisco, California, United States of America.']","Francisco Esmaile de Sales Lima, Samuel Paulo Cibulski, Helton Fernandes Dos Santos, Thais Fumaco Teixeira, Ana Paula Muterle Varela, Paulo Michel Roehe, Eric Delwart, Ana Cláudia Franco, ",PloS one,2015,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25688970

The Clade I isolates were further sub-divided into two groups. The first group was closer to carnivore isolates that predominate in central Brazil, whereas the second group more closely resembled wild fox isolates from the northeastern coastal state of Paraíba (PB). MA isolates of Clade II formed an entirely separate group.

420,"Molecular survey of RNA viruses in Hungarian bats: discovering novel astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses","Background: Bat-borne viruses pose a potential risk to human health and are the focus of increasing scientific interest. To start gaining information about bat-transmitted viruses in Hungary, we tested multiple bat species for several virus groups between 2012 and 2013. Materials and methods:
        
      
      Fecal samples were collected from bats across Hungary. We performed group-specific RT-PCR screening for astro-, calici-, corona-, lyssa-, othoreo-, paramyxo-, and rotaviruses. Positive samples were selected and sequenced for further phylogenetic analyses. Results:
        
      
      A total of 447 fecal samples, representing 24 European bat species were tested. Novel strains of astroviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses were detected and analyzed phylogenetically. Out of the 447 tested samples, 40 (9%) bats were positive for at least one virus. Bat-transmitted astroviruses (BtAstV) were detected in eight species with a 6.93% detection rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.854, 9.571). Coronaviruses (BtCoV) were detected in seven bat species with a detection rate of 1.79% (95% CI 0.849, 3.348), whereas novel caliciviruses (BtCalV) were detected in three bat species with a detection rate of 0.67% (95% CI 0.189, 1.780). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a great diversity among astrovirus strains, whereas the Hungarian BtCoV strains clustered together with both alpha- and betacoronavirus strains from other European countries. One of the most intriguing findings of our investigation is the discovery of novel BtCalVs in Europe. The Hungarian BtCalV did not cluster with any of the calcivirus genera identified in the family so far. Conclusions:
        
      
      We have successfully confirmed BtCoVs in numerous bat species. Furthermore, we have described new bat species harboring BtAstVs in Europe and found new species of CalVs.

422,Low genetic diversities of rabies virus populations within different hosts in Brazil,"The low rates of nonsynonymous evolution observed in natural rabies virus (RABV) isolates are suggested to have arisen in association with the structural and functional constraints operating on the virus protein and the infection strategies employed by RABV within infected hosts to avoid strong selection by the immune response. In order to investigate the relationship between the genetic characteristics of RABV populations within hosts and the virus evolution, the present study examined the genetic heterogeneities of RABV populations within naturally infected dogs and foxes in Brazil, as well as those of bat RABV populations that were passaged once in suckling mice. Sequence analyses of complete RABV glycoprotein (G) genes showed that RABV populations within infected hosts were genetically highly homogeneous whether they were infected naturally or experimentally (nucleotide diversities of 0-0.95x10(-3)). In addition, amino acid mutations were randomly distributed over the entire region of the G protein, and the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (d(N)/d(S)) for the G protein gene were less than 1. These findings suggest that the low genetic diversities of RABV populations within hosts reflect the stabilizing selection operating on the virus, the infection strategies of the virus, and eventually, the evolutionary patterns of the virus.","['1 Nihon University Veterinary Research Center, 1866 Kameino, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-8510, Japan.']","Yuki Kobayashi, Yoshiyuki Suzuki, Takuya Itou, Adolorata A B Carvalho, Elenice M S Cunha, Fumio H Ito, Takashi Gojobori, Takeo Sakai, ","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20018256

Although some exceptions exist, substitution at this position causes expression of a phenotype that is either less pathogenic or non-virulent. To date, such substitutions have only been found in fixed strains of rabies virus. In this study, the authors found 333H, 333N, and 333Q substitutions at this position in rabies virus street strains isolated from non-hematophagous bats in Brazil. These strains showed pathogenicity and lethality on passage using adult mice with the intracerebral route and were confirmed rabies-positive by immunofluorescent assay. This suggests that these strains maintain virulence.

Consequently, prediction of the spread of these viruses and the establishment of appropriate control measures are hindered by a lack of information. To this aim, we collected epidemiological, virological and ecological data during a twelve-year longitudinal study in two colonies of insectivorous bats (Myotis myotis) located in Spain and infected by the most common bat lyssavirus found in Europe, the European bat lyssavirus subtype 1 (EBLV-1). This active survey demonstrates that cyclic lyssavirus infections occurred with periodic oscillations in the number of susceptible, immune and infected bats. Persistence of immunity for more than one year was detected in some individuals. These data were further used to feed models to analyze the temporal dynamics of EBLV-1 and the survival rate of bats. According to these models, the infection is characterized by a predicted low basic reproductive rate (R(0) = 1.706) and a short infectious period (D = 5.1 days). In contrast to observations in most non-flying animals infected with rabies, the survival model shows no variation in mortality after EBLV-1 infection of M. myotis. These findings have considerable public health implications in terms of management of colonies where lyssavirus-positive bats have been recorded and confirm the potential risk of rabies transmission to humans. A greater understanding of the dynamics of lyssavirus in bat colonies also provides a model to study how bats contribute to the maintenance and transmission of other viruses of public health concern.","['1 UPRE Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation, WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; Department de Biologia Animal, Facultat de Biolgia, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']","Blanca Amengual, Hervé Bourhy, Marc López-Roig, Jordi Serra-Cobo, ",PloS one,2007,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17593965
427,Isolation of a novel Rhabdovirus from an insectivorous bat (Pipistrellus kuhlii) in Italy,"Background:
        
      
      Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse families of RNA viruses which can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy. Methods:
        
      
      Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol. Results:
        
      
      A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5'). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats. Conclusions:
        
      
      VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated.","[""1 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Via Bianchi 9 -, 25124, Brescia, Italy. davide.lelli@izsler.it."", ""2 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Via Bianchi 9 -, 25124, Brescia, Italy."", '3 Wildlife Rehabilitation Center WWF of Valpredina via Pioda n.1, 24060 Cenate Sopra (BG), Bergamo, Italy.', ""4 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVE), Viale dell'Università, 10 - 35020 Legnaro (PD), Padova, Italy.""]","Davide Lelli, Alice Prosperi, Ana Moreno, Chiara Chiapponi, Anna Maria Gibellini, Paola De Benedictis, Stefania Leopardi, Enrica Sozzi, Antonio Lavazza, ",Virology journal,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29454370
428,Viral Metagenomic Data Analyses of Five New World Bat Species from Argentina: Identification of 35 Novel DNA Viruses,"Bats are natural reservoirs of a variety of zoonotic viruses, many of which cause severe human diseases. Characterizing viruses of bats inhabiting different geographical regions is important for understanding their viral diversity and for detecting viral spillovers between animal species. Herein, the diversity of DNA viruses of five arthropodophagous bat species from Argentina was investigated using metagenomics. Fecal samples of 29 individuals from five species (Tadarida brasiliensis, Molossus molossus, Eumops bonariensis, Eumops patagonicus, and Eptesicus diminutus) living at two different geographical locations, were investigated. Enriched viral DNA was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, and the reads were trimmed and filtered using several bioinformatic approaches. The resulting nucleotide sequences were subjected to viral taxonomic classification. In total, 4,520,370 read pairs were sequestered by sequencing, and 21.1% of them mapped to viral taxa. Circoviridae and Genomoviridae were the most prevalent among vertebrate viral families in all bat species included in this study. Samples from the T. brasiliensis colony exhibited lower viral diversity than samples from other species of New World bats. We characterized 35 complete genome sequences of novel viruses. These findings provide new insights into the global diversity of bat viruses in poorly studied species, contributing to prevention of emerging zoonotic diseases and to conservation policies for endangered species.","['1 Grupo Virología Humana, Instituto de Biología Molecular y Celular de Rosario (CONICET), Suipacha 590, Rosario 2000, Argentina.', '2 Área Virología, Facultad de Ciencias Bioquímicas y Farmacéuticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Suipacha 531, Rosario 2000, Argentina.', '3 DETx MOL S.A., Centro Científico Tecnológico CONICET Rosario, Ocampo y Esmeralda, Rosario 2000, Argentina.', '4 Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Zaloška 4, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', '5 Museo Provincial de Ciencias Naturales ""Dr. Ángel Gallardo"", San Lorenzo 1949, Rosario 2000, Argentina.', '6 Programa de Conservación de los Murciélagos de Argentina, Miguel Lillo 251, San Miguel de Tucumán 4000, Argentina.', '7 Instituto PIDBA (Programa de Investigaciones de Biodiversidad Argentina), Facultad de Ciencias Naturales e Instituto Miguel Lillo, Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Miguel Lillo 205, San Miguel de Tucumán 4000, Argentina.', '8 Área Estadística y Procesamiento de Datos, Facultad de Ciencias Bioquímicas y Farmacéuticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Suipacha 531, Rosario 2000, Argentina.']","Elisa M Bolatti, Gastón Viarengo, Tomaz M Zorec, Agustina Cerri, María E Montani, Lea Hosnjak, Pablo E Casal, Eugenia Bortolotto, Violeta Di Domenica, Diego Chouhy, María Belén Allasia, Rubén M Barquez, Mario Poljak, Adriana A Giri, ",Microorganisms,2022,Anelloviridae; Chiroptera; Cossaviricota; Cressdnaviricota; metagenomics; virome; virus identification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35208721
429,Characterizing and Evaluating the Zoonotic Potential of Novel Viruses Discovered in Vampire Bats,"The contemporary surge in metagenomic sequencing has transformed knowledge of viral diversity in wildlife. However, evaluating which newly discovered viruses pose sufficient risk of infecting humans to merit detailed laboratory characterization and surveillance remains largely speculative. Machine learning algorithms have been developed to address this imbalance by ranking the relative likelihood of human infection based on viral genome sequences, but are not yet routinely applied to viruses at the time of their discovery. Here, we characterized viral genomes detected through metagenomic sequencing of feces and saliva from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and used these data as a case study in evaluating zoonotic potential using molecular sequencing data. Of 58 detected viral families, including 17 which infect mammals, the only known zoonosis detected was rabies virus; however, additional genomes were detected from the families Hepeviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, Astroviridae and Picornaviridae, all of which contain human-infecting species. In phylogenetic analyses, novel vampire bat viruses most frequently grouped with other bat viruses that are not currently known to infect humans. In agreement, machine learning models built from only phylogenetic information ranked all novel viruses similarly, yielding little insight into zoonotic potential. In contrast, genome composition-based machine learning models estimated different levels of zoonotic potential, even for closely related viruses, categorizing one out of four detected hepeviruses and two out of three picornaviruses as having high priority for further research. We highlight the value of evaluating zoonotic potential beyond ad hoc consideration of phylogeny and provide surveillance recommendations for novel viruses in a wildlife host which has frequent contact with humans and domestic animals.","['1 Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK.', '2 MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow G61 1QH, UK.', '3 Association for the Conservation and Development of Natural Resources, Lima 15037, Peru.', '4 Yunkawasi, Lima 15049, Peru.']","Laura M Bergner, Nardus Mollentze, Richard J Orton, Carlos Tello, Alice Broos, Roman Biek, Daniel G Streicker, ",Viruses,2021,Chiroptera; machine learning; phylogenetics; rabies virus; wildlife disease; zoonosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33562073
430,Host Genetic Variation Does Not Determine Spatio-Temporal Patterns of European Bat 1 Lyssavirus,"The majority of bat rabies cases in Europe are attributed to European bat 1 lyssavirus (EBLV-1), circulating mainly in serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus). Two subtypes have been defined (EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b), each associated with a different geographical distribution. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive sequence analysis based on 80 newly obtained EBLV-1 nearly complete genome sequences from nine European countries over a 45-year period to infer selection pressures, rates of nucleotide substitution, and evolutionary time scale of these two subtypes in Europe. Our results suggest that the current lineage of EBLV-1 arose in Europe ∼600 years ago and the virus has evolved at an estimated average substitution rate of ∼4.19×10-5 subs/site/year, which is among the lowest recorded for RNA viruses. In parallel, we investigate the genetic structure of French serotine bats at both the nuclear and mitochondrial level and find that they constitute a single genetic cluster. Furthermore, Mantel tests based on interindividual distances reveal the absence of correlation between genetic distances estimated between viruses and between host individuals. Taken together, this indicates that the genetic diversity observed in our E. serotinus samples does not account for EBLV-1a and -1b segregation and dispersal in Europe.","['1 Institut Pasteur, Unit Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation, WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rabies, Paris, France.', '2 Institut Pasteur de Guinée, BP 1147 Université Gamal Abdel Nasser de Conakry (UGANC), Conakry, Guinea.', '3 Laboratory for Rabies and Wildlife ANSES, Nancy, OIE Reference Laboratory for Rabies, European Union Reference Laboratory for Rabies, European Union Reference Laboratory for Rabies Serology, WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Management on Zoonoses, Malzeville, France.', '4 Institut Pasteur, Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute, KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Belgium.', '5 Unité de la Génétique Fonctionnelle des Maladies Infectieuses, Paris, France.']","Cécile Troupin, Evelyne Picard-Meyer, Simon Dellicour, Isabelle Casademont, Lauriane Kergoat, Anthony Lepelletier, Laurent Dacheux, Guy Baele, Elodie Monchâtre-Leroy, Florence Cliquet, Philippe Lemey, Hervé Bourhy, ",Genome biology and evolution,2017,European bat 1 lyssavirus (EBLV-1); RNA virus evolution; genome sequence; next generation sequencing; serotine bat.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29165566

Sequences of 890 nts of nucleoprotein (N) genes of these isolates were analyzed and compared with those of other Brazilian isolates characterized earlier. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three genetical lineages of RV co-existing in this region. Each lineage was found to be associated with particular host species and to circulate independently of each other. The first lineage was found in foxes (Dusicyon sp.) and could be discriminated from domestic carnivore isolates from Sao Paulo, Goias and Minas Gerais in the southern and central Brazil. The second lineage was associated with insectivorous bats (Molossus spp.) and differed from vampire bat-associated RV isolates. The third lineage was found in livestock and clustered with vampire bat-associated RV isolates from Sao Paulo, Tocantins, Goias and Matto Grosso.

Sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly conserved RNA polymerase gene (pol) showed that all coronaviruses detected in this study are genetically closely related, with 99.5-100% nucleotide identity, and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses. The most closely related virus sequence in GenBank was SARS bat isolate Rp3/2004 (DQ071615) within the SARS-like CoV cluster, sharing 85% nucleotide identity and 95.6% amino acid identity. The potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human infections is highly suspected, and further molecular epidemiologic studies of these bat coronaviruses are needed.","['1 Virology Unit, Veterinary Faculty, Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology, University of Ljubljana, Gerbiceva 60, 1115 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']","Danijela Rihtaric, Peter Hostnik, Andrej Steyer, Joze Grom, Ivan Toplak, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20217155

Additionally, about 1226 blood samples were tested serologically, and varying virus neutralizing antibody titres were found in at least eight different bat species. The detection of viral RNA and seroconversion in repeatedly sampled serotine bats indicates long-term circulation of the virus in a particular bat colony.

We reveal molecular features in SrC such as purine richness and RNA secondary structures that resemble those required for FCS acquisition in avian influenza viruses. We discuss the potential acquisition of FCS through molecular mechanisms such as nucleotide substitution, insertion, or recombination, and show that a single nucleotide exchange in two European bat-associated SrC may suffice to enable furin cleavage. Furthermore, we show that FCS occurrence is variable in bat- and rodent-borne counterparts of human coronaviruses. Our results suggest that furin cleavage sites can be acquired in SrC via conserved molecular mechanisms known in other reservoir-bound RNA viruses and thus support a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2.","['1 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Virology, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Department of Zoology and Anthropology, Faculty of Biology, Sofia University ""St. Kl.

To understand fully the epidemiology, genetic variation and evolution of the rabies virus, full-length viral genomes need to be obtained. For rabies virus studies, cDNA synthesis is usually performed using nonspecific oligonucleotides followed by cloning. When specific primers are used, the cDNA obtained is only partial and is limited to the coding regions. Therefore, the development of methods for synthesizing long cDNA using rabies virus-specific primers is of fundamental importance. A new protocol for the synthesis of long cDNA and the development of 19 new primers are described in this study. This procedure allowed the efficient amplification of the full-length genome of the rabies virus variant maintained by hematophagous bat (Desmodus rotundus) populations following the synthesis of a complete long cDNA. Partial sequencing of the rabies virus genome was performed to confirm rabies-specific PCR amplification. Because degenerate primers were employed, this technique can be adapted easily to other variants. Importantly, this new method is faster and less expensive than cloning methods.","['1 Núcleo de Pesquisas em Raiva do Laboratório de Virologia Clínica e Molecular da Universidade de São Paulo, CEP: 05508-900, São Paulo, Brazil. camposac@usp.br']","Angélica Cristine de Almeida Campos, Fernando Lucas Melo, Camila Malta Romano, Danielle Bastos Araujo, Elenice Maria Sequetin Cunha, Débora Regina Veiga Sacramento, Paolo Marinho de Andrade Zanotto, Edison Luiz Durigon, Silvana Regina Favoretto, ",Journal of virological methods,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21473884
441,Genomic characterization of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in European bats and classification of coronaviruses based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene sequences,"Bats may host emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoV). We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4×10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV. Critical spike domains 472 and 487 were identical and similar, respectively.

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was employed as a simultaneous detection method for both rabies field variants within 60 min. Vampire bat-related rabies viruses could be distinguished from dog variants by digesting amplicons of the RT-LAMP reaction using the restriction enzyme AlwI. Amplification and digestion could both be completed within 120 min after RNA extraction. In addition, the RT-LAMP assay also detected rabies virus in isolates from Brazilian frugivorous bats and Ugandan dog, bovine and goat samples. In contrast, there were false negative results from several Brazilian insectivorous bats and all of Chinese dog, pig, and bovine samples using the RT-LAMP assay. This study showed that the RT-LAMP assay is effective for the rapid detection of rabies virus isolates from the primary reservoir in Brazil. Further improvements are necessary so that the RT-LAMP assay can be employed for the universal detection of genetic variants of rabies virus in the field.","['1 Nihon University Veterinary Research Center, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.']","Yasumasa Saitou, Yuki Kobayashi, Shinji Hirano, Nobuyuki Mochizuki, Takuya Itou, Fumio H Ito, Takeo Sakai, ",Journal of virological methods,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20403387
443,Genome sequence of an aichivirus detected in a common pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus),"The family Picornaviridae includes important human and animal pathogens that are associated with a wide range of diseases and, in some cases, have zoonotic potential. During epidemiological surveillance of bats, we identified, by next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, the presence of picornavirus RNA in a common pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). By coupling NGS, primer-walking strategies, and sequence-independent protocols to obtain the sequences of the 5' and 3' termini, we reconstructed the genome sequence of picornavirus strain ITA/2017/189/18-155. The genome of the bat picornavirus is 8.2 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein of 2462 amino acids. A comparison of polyprotein sequences revealed that this virus is distantly related (65.1% and 70.9% sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively) to a bat aichivirus identified in 2010. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this picornavirus clustered closely with members of the genus Kobuvirus, which also includes human and animal aichiviruses. The identification of aichiviruses in several animal hosts is providing hints that will lead to an understanding of their origin and evolutionary patterns.","['1 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari Aldo Moro, S.p. per Casamassima km3, 70010, Valenzano, Bari, Italy.', '2 Institute of Food Safety, Feed and Environment, Veterinary Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Gerbičeva 60, 1000, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', ""3 Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9 - 25124, Brescia, Italy."", '4 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari Aldo Moro, S.p. per Casamassima km3, 70010, Valenzano, Bari, Italy. vito.martella@uniba.it.', '5 Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology, Veterinary Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Gerbičeva 60, 1000, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']","Georgia Diakoudi, Urška Jamnikar-Ciglenečki, Gianvito Lanave, Davide Lelli, Vito Martella, Urška Kuhar, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32056001
444,Application of broad-spectrum resequencing microarray for genotyping rhabdoviruses,"The rapid and accurate identification of pathogens is critical in the control of infectious disease. To this end, we analyzed the capacity for viral detection and identification of a newly described high-density resequencing microarray (RMA), termed PathogenID, which was designed for multiple pathogen detection using database similarity searching. We focused on one of the largest and most diverse viral families described to date, the family Rhabdoviridae. We demonstrate that this approach has the potential to identify both known and related viruses for which precise sequence information is unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that a strategy based on consensus sequence determination for analysis of RMA output data enabled successful detection of viruses exhibiting up to 26% nucleotide divergence with the closest sequence tiled on the array. Using clinical specimens obtained from rabid patients and animals, this method also shows a high species level concordance with standard reference assays, indicating that it is amenable for the development of diagnostic assays. Finally, 12 animal rhabdoviruses which were currently unclassified, unassigned, or assigned as tentative species within the family Rhabdoviridae were successfully detected. These new data allowed an unprecedented phylogenetic analysis of 106 rhabdoviruses and further suggest that the principles and methodology developed here may be used for the broad-spectrum surveillance and the broader-scale investigation of biodiversity in the viral world.","['1 Institut Pasteur, Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host Adaptation Unit, Paris, France.']","Laurent Dacheux, Nicolas Berthet, Gabriel Dissard, Edward C Holmes, Olivier Delmas, Florence Larrous, Ghislaine Guigon, Philip Dickinson, Ousmane Faye, Amadou A Sall, Iain G Old, Katherine Kong, Giulia C Kennedy, Jean-Claude Manuguerra, Stewart T Cole, Valérie Caro, Antoine Gessain, Hervé Bourhy, ",Journal of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20610710
445,Ecological and Conservation Significance of Herpesvirus Infection in Neotropical Bats,"Bats are the second most diverse order of mammals and key species for ecosystem functioning, providing a wide range of ecosystem services, from pest control to seed dispersal. Chiropterans are known for hosting a large diversity of viruses, in some cases with little or no effect to their health. Here, we report on the results of a screening for DNA (Herpesviridae) and RNA viruses (Rhabdovirus and Pneumovirus), finding a high prevalence and wide diversity of both Beta- and Gamma-Herpesvirus in insectivorous and hematophagous bats of the southern cone of South America. Our findings suggest that bats in the southern neotropics harbor a high diversity of herpesviruses and, at least in some cases, the viral community in the bat species is more strongly associated with ecological traits of the hosts, rather than their taxonomy. The presence of a separate clade into the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily in the common vampire bat suggests the independent circulation of herpesviruses in hematophagous and insectivorous bats and highlights the properness of these viruses to track vampire bats' population structure for rabies studies. Hence, we suggest that as other pathogens viruses may be used to track the population dynamics of their hosts, including movement and demographics.","['1 Sección Virología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de La República, Iguá 4225, 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay.', '2 Programa Para La Conservación de Los Murciélagos de Uruguay, Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, Montevideo, Uruguay.', '3 Departamento de Métodos Cuantitativos, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de La República, Montevideo, Uruguay.', '4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Montana State University, Bozeman, USA.', '5 Sección Virología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de La República, Iguá 4225, 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay. adriana@fcien.edu.uy.', '6 Sección Virología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de La República, Iguá 4225, 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay. sfrabasile@fcien.edu.uy.']","Lucía Moreira Marrero, Germán Botto Nuñez, Lucía Malta, Adriana Delfraro, Sandra Frabasile, ",EcoHealth,NO_DATE,Chiroptera; Herpesvirus; Pneumovirus; Rabies virus; Uruguay.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34184171
446,Bat rabies in France: a 24-year retrospective epidemiological study,"Since bat rabies surveillance was first implemented in France in 1989, 48 autochthonous rabies cases without human contamination have been reported using routine diagnosis methods. In this retrospective study, data on bats submitted for rabies testing were analysed in order to better understand the epidemiology of EBLV-1 in bats in France and to investigate some epidemiological trends. Of the 3176 bats submitted for rabies diagnosis from 1989 to 2013, 1.96% (48/2447 analysed) were diagnosed positive. Among the twelve recognised virus species within the Lyssavirus genus, two species were isolated in France. 47 positive bats were morphologically identified as Eptesicus serotinus and were shown to be infected by both the EBLV-1a and the EBLV-1b lineages. Isolation of BBLV in Myotis nattereri was reported once in the north-east of France in 2012. The phylogenetic characterisation of all 47 French EBLV-1 isolates sampled between 1989 and 2013 and the French BBLV sample against 21 referenced partial nucleoprotein sequences confirmed the low genetic diversity of EBLV-1 despite its extensive geographical range. Statistical analysis performed on the serotine bat data collected from 1989 to 2013 showed seasonal variation of rabies occurrence with a significantly higher proportion of positive samples detected during the autumn compared to the spring and the summer period (34% of positive bats detected in autumn, 15% in summer, 13% in spring and 12% in winter). In this study, we have provided the details of the geographical distribution of EBLV-1a in the south-west of France and the north-south division of EBLV-1b with its subdivisions into three phylogenetic groups: group B1 in the north-west, group B2 in the centre and group B3 in the north-east of France.","['1 French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), Nancy Laboratory for Rabies and Wildlife, OIE Reference Laboratory for Rabies, European Union Reference Laboratory for Rabies, European Union Reference Laboratory for Rabies Serology, Malzeville, France.', ""2 Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Bourges, Bourges, France."", ""3 SFEPM Chiroptera Group, Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Bourges, Bourges, France."", '4 Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union, Perl-Kesslingen, Germany.']","Evelyne Picard-Meyer, Emmanuelle Robardet, Laurent Arthur, Gérald Larcher, Christine Harbusch, Alexandre Servat, Florence Cliquet, ",PloS one,2014,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24892287
447,Systematics of Mepraia (Hemiptera-Reduviidae): cytogenetic and molecular variation,"The haematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae (Hemiptera-Reduviidae) have great epidemiological importance as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Mepraia was originally described as a monotypic genus comprised of Mepraia spinolai, distributed along coastal areas of northern Chile (from Region I to the Metropolitan Region). Recently, some M. spinolai populations have been ranked as a new species named Mepraia gajardoi. Several populations along the distribution range of the genus were sampled, and genetic differentiation was studied based upon the analysis of three molecular markers: cytogenetics (karyotype and chromosome behaviour during meiosis using the C-banding technique), mitochondrial DNA (a cytochrome oxidase I gene fragment), and nuclear ribosomal DNA (intergenic region including the two internal transcribed spacers ITS-1 and ITS-2 and the 5.8S rRNA gene). The data here presented indicate that populations within the Mepraia genus (excluding Region II specimens) can be divided into two separate lineages. One lineage is comprised of specimens from the northernmost Region I and represents M. gajardoi. The other includes samples from the southern III, IV and the Metropolitan Regions, and represents M. spinolai. Region II individuals deserve particular attention as their relationship to the two identified lineages is not clear-cut. While they appear to belong to M. spinolai based on cytogenetics and rDNA markers, COI results indicate a closer relationship to M. gajardoi. This disagreement can be due to mitochondrial DNA introgression or the retention of ancestral polymorphisms.","['1 Sección Genética Evolutiva, Instituto de Biología, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la República, Iguá 4225, 11400 Montevideo, Uruguay.']","L Calleros, F Panzera, M D Bargues, F A Monteiro, D R Klisiowicz, M A Zuriaga, S Mas-Coma, R Pérez, ","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20018255

Caliciviruses are important human and animal pathogens and, as observed for human noroviruses, they may impact on human health on a global scale. By screening fecal samples of bats in Hungary, calicivirus RNA was identified in the samples of Myotis daubentonii and Eptesicus serotinus bats. In order to characterize more in detail the bat caliciviruses, large portions of the genome sequence of the viruses were determined. Phylogenetic analyses and molecular modeling identified firmly the two viruses as candidate members within the Caliciviridae family, with one calicivirus strain resembling members of the Sapovirus genus and the other bat calicivirus being more related to porcine caliciviruses of the proposed genus Valovirus. This data serves the effort for detecting reservoir hosts for potential emerging viruses and recognize important evolutionary relationships.","['1 Virological Research Group, János Szentágothai Research Center, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary; Institute of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary.', '2 Department of Applied Genomics, Agricultural Institute, Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Martonvásár, Hungary.', '3 Department of Zoology, Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, Hungary; Institute for Veterinary Medical Research, Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '4 Aggtelek National Park Directorate, Jósvafő, Hungary.', '5 Department of Zoology, Eszterházy Károly College, Eger, Hungary.', '6 Institute for Veterinary Medical Research, Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '7 Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universitá Aldo Moro di Bari, Valenzano, Italy.', '8 Virological Research Group, János Szentágothai Research Center, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary; Institute of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary.

449,"Novel papillomaviruses in free-ranging Iberian bats: no virus-host co-evolution, no strict host specificity, and hints for recombination","Papillomaviruses (PVs) are widespread pathogens. However, the extent of PV infections in bats remains largely unknown. This work represents the first comprehensive study of PVs in Iberian bats. We identified four novel PVs in the mucosa of free-ranging Eptesicus serotinus (EserPV1, EserPV2, and EserPV3) and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (RferPV1) individuals and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships within the viral family. We further assessed their prevalence in different populations of E. serotinus and its close relative E. isabellinus. Although it is frequent to read that PVs co-evolve with their host, that PVs are highly species-specific, and that PVs do not usually recombine, our results suggest otherwise. First, strict virus-host co-evolution is rejected by the existence of five, distantly related bat PV lineages and by the lack of congruence between bats and bat PVs phylogenies. Second, the ability of EserPV2 and EserPV3 to infect two different bat species (E. serotinus and E. isabellinus) argues against strict host specificity. Finally, the description of a second noncoding region in the RferPV1 genome reinforces the view of an increased susceptibility to recombination in the E2-L2 genomic region. These findings prompt the question of whether the prevailing paradigms regarding PVs evolution should be reconsidered.","['1 Infections and Cancer Laboratory, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO), Barcelona, Spain.']","Raquel García-Pérez, Carlos Ibáñez, Jose M Godínez, Nidia Aréchiga, Inazio Garin, Gonzalo Pérez-Suárez, Oscar de Paz, Javier Juste, Juan E Echevarría, Ignacio G Bravo, ",Genome biology and evolution,NO_DATE,bats; biodiversity; evolution; papillomavirus; phylogeny; wildlife.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24391150

451,Paramyxovirus circulation in bat species from French Guiana,"Bats are recognized as reservoirs of numerous viruses. Among them, paramyxoviruses, for example, Hendra and Nipah viruses, are highly pathogenic to humans. Nothing is known regarding the circulation of this viral family in bats from French Guiana. To search for the presence of paramyxoviruses in this territory, 103 bats of seven different species were sampled and screened using a molecular approach. Four distinct paramyxovirus sequences were detected from three bat species (Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, and Pteronotus alitonus) at high prevalence rates. In D. rotundus, two types of paramyxovirus co-circulate, with most of the bats co-infected. The phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed that three of them were closely related to previously characterized sequences from D. rotundus, C. perspicillata, and P. parnellii from Brazil and Costa Rica. The fourth sequence, identified in D. rotundus, was closely related to the one detected in P. alitonus in French Guiana and to previously described sequences detected in P. parnellii in Costa Rica. All paramyxovirus sequences detected in this study are close to the Jeilongvirus genus. Altogether, our results and those of previous studies indicate a wide geographical distribution of these paramyxoviruses (from Central to South America) and suggest potential cross-species transmissions of paramyxoviruses between two different bat families: Mormoopidae (P. alitonus) and Phyllostomidae (D. rotundus). In addition, their closeness to paramyxoviruses identified in rodents emphasizes the need to investigate the role of these animals as potential reservoirs or incidental hosts. Finally, the high prevalence rates of some paramyxoviruses in certain bat species, associated with the presence of large bat colonies and, in some cases, their potential proximity with humans are all parameters that can contribute to the risk of cross-species transmission between bat species and to the emergence of new paramyxoviruses in humans, a risk that deserves further investigation.","['1 Laboratoire des Interaction Virus Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana.

452,"Genetic identification of a rabies virus from an insectivorous bat in an urban area of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","In Latin America, hematophagous bats are the main reservoirs of rabies virus (RABV) to livestock, to other mammals and, occasionally, to human. Nonetheless, reports of exposure of human and pets to RABV upon aggression by non-hematophagous bats are increasing, possibly facilitated by the synanthropic habits of these bats. We, herein, report the detection and genetic identification of a RABV recovered from an insectivorous bat found sick in a student housing building at the Federal University of Santa Maria, Southern Brazil. Taxonomic characterization identified the captured bat as a member of the genus Nyctinomops, family Molossidae, the group of insectivorous bats. Brain fragments of the bat were positive for RABV antigens by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and for sequences of the nucleoprotein (N) gene by RT-PCR. The N amplicon was submitted to nucleotide sequencing and analysis, showing that the consensus sequences (SV 33/19) had high identity with RABV sequences of insectivorous bats deposited in GenBank. At phylogenetic tree, the N gene sequences of SV 33/19 clustered with RABV recovered from Nyctinomops laticaudatus, Molossus molossus, and Tadarida lauticaudata bats, and a part of RABV variant 3, 4, and 6, that correspond to Desmodus rotundus, Tadarida brasiliensis, and Lasiurus cinereus, respectively. Although no direct human or domestic animal exposure has been reported, this case strengthens the need for a continuous rabies vaccination in pets in the surrounding areas, since non-hematophagous bats may serve as source of infection for these animals. These findings also call attention for continuous monitoring of populations of synanthropic bats to avoid/prevent human exposure.","['1 Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Centro de Ciências Rurais, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Av.

455,"Antigenic and genotypic characterization of rabies virus isolated from bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) from municipalities in São Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil","Bats have aroused growing attention in the public health sphere because they are considered the main reservoir of rabies virus (RABV) in the Americas, in places where canine rabies is under control. Antigenic and genetic studies of RABV isolates have been used to describe the epidemiological profile of rabies and to identify possible hosts/reservoirs for different epidemiological cycles. This study describes the antigenic and genotypic characterization of 19 RABV isolates from central nervous system samples of non-hematophagous bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera). These bats were diagnosed as RABV positive by direct fluorescent antibody and mouse inoculation tests. Antigenic characterization using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies revealed that 7 of 19 RABV isolates from these bats belonged to variant 3, for which the hematophagous bat species Desmodus rotundus is the main reservoir, and 1 of 19 RABV isolates from an insectivorous bat belonged to variant 4, which is characteristic of these bats. The remaining 11 RABV samples were divided into six non-compatible profiles. The isolates were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the N gene and partially sequenced. Genetic characterization of these isolates was performed by grouping the sequences obtained with known RABV lineages. The sequences were grouped in clusters by the phylogenetic inference neighbor-joining method, together with another 89 homologous sequences obtained from GenBank. This analysis grouped the isolates into four known lineages: Nyctinomops Brazil, Myotis Brazil, Eptesicus Brazil and D. rotundus Brazil, as well as another cluster that may define a RABV lineage not yet characterized, here named Myotis Brazil II, for which bats of the genus Myotis apparently act as reservoirs. This assumption of a new lineage is also based on the observation of amino acid substitutions, with an average intraspecific identity of 99.8%, varying from 99.6 to 100.0% for nucleotides and 100.0% for amino acids.","['1 Department of Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Rubião Jr. District, Botucatu, São Paulo, 18618-970, Brazil.', '2 Pasteur Institute, 393 Paulista Ave., São Paulo, São Paulo, 01311-000, Brazil.', '3 Department of Public Health, School of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, 126 Tessália Vieira de Camargo St., Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-887, Brazil.', '4 Adolfo Lutz Institute, Bauru II Center of Regional Laboratories, 6000 Rubens Arruda St., Bauru, São Paulo, 17015-110, Brazil.', '5 Department of Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Rubião Jr. District, Botucatu, São Paulo, 18618-970, Brazil. hlangoni@fmvz.unesp.br.']","Benedito Donizete Menozzi, Rafael de Novaes Oliveira, Laís Moraes Paiz, Virgínia Bodelão Richini-Pereira, Helio Langoni, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28108804
456,Diversification of mammalian deltaviruses by host shifting,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is an unusual RNA agent that replicates using host machinery but exploits hepatitis B virus (HBV) to mobilize its spread within and between hosts. In doing so, HDV enhances the virulence of HBV. How this seemingly improbable hyperparasitic lifestyle emerged is unknown, but it underpins the likelihood that HDV and related deltaviruses may alter other host-virus interactions. Here, we show that deltaviruses diversify by transmitting between mammalian species. Among 96,695 RNA sequence datasets, deltaviruses infected bats, rodents, and an artiodactyl from the Americas but were absent from geographically overrepresented Old World representatives of each mammalian order, suggesting a relatively recent diversification within the Americas. Consistent with diversification by host shifting, both bat and rodent-infecting deltaviruses were paraphyletic, and coevolutionary modeling rejected cospeciation with mammalian hosts. In addition, a 2-y field study showed common vampire bats in Peru were infected by two divergent deltaviruses, indicating multiple introductions to a single host species. One vampire bat-associated deltavirus was detected in the saliva of up to 35% of individuals, formed phylogeographically compartmentalized clades, and infected a sympatric bat, illustrating horizontal transmission within and between species on ecological timescales.

Brief report,"Forty-one isolates of rabies virus from insectivorous bats and one from a domestic cat in Chile, were characterized using eight anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies (N-Mabs) and by nucleotide sequence analysis. Thirty-two isolates were identified as antigenic variant 4 associated with Tadarida brasiliensis bats, twenty-eight were genetically associated with variant Tadarida brasiliensis and four with Lasiurus sp. bats. One isolate was identified as antigenic variant 3 associated with Desmodus rotundus bats, and by genetic analysis was identified as variant Myotis sp. bat. Eight isolates were unrelated to any antigenic variant, and they were identified as a genetic variant associated with Histiotus sp. bats. These antigenic and genetic characterizations may establish epidemiological links between rabies cases and increase the understanding of rabies epidemiology in this country.","['1 Laboratorio de Diagnóstico de Rabia, Instituto de Salud Pública de Chile, Santiago, Chile. vyung@ispch.cl']","V Yung, M Favi, J Fernández, ",Archives of virology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12417953

The aims of this study were to (a) establish genealogies for RABV strains from different species of Brazilian insectivorous bats based on the nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes, (b) investigate specific RABV lineages associated with certain genera of bats and (c) identify molecular markers that can distinguish between these lineages. The genealogic analysis of N and G from 57 RABV strains revealed seven genus-specific clusters related to the insectivorous bats Myotis, Eptesicus, Nyctinomops, Molossus, Tadarida, Histiotus and Lasiurus. Molecular markers in the amino acid sequences were identified which were specific to the seven clusters. These results, which constitute a novel finding for this pathogen, show that there are at least seven independent epidemiological rabies cycles maintained by seven genera of insectivorous bats in Brazil.","['1 Instituto Pasteur of São Paulo, CEP 01311-000, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. rafaeldenovaes@yahoo.com.br']","Rafael de Novaes Oliveira, Sibele Pinheiro de Souza, Renata Spinelli Vaz Lobo, Juliana Galera Castilho, Carla Isabel Macedo, Pedro Carnieli Jr, Willian Oliveira Fahl, Samira Maria Achkar, Karin Corrêa Scheffer, Ivanete Kotait, Maria Luiza Carrieri, Paulo Eduardo Brandão, ",Virology,2010,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20609456

The clinical syndromes for these cases included dysphagia and encephalitis. Because bat bites were a common occurrence in the affected areas, the initial clinical diagnosis was rabies. However, rabies was discounted primarily because of reported patient recovery. Samples of brain tissue from two of the fatal cases were received at CDC for laboratory confirmation of the rabies diagnosis. An extensive array of tests on the formalin-fixed tissues confirmed the presence of both rabies viral antigen and nucleic acid. The virus was shown to be most closely related to a vampire bat rabies isolate. These results indicate the importance of maintaining rabies in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile encephalitis, particularly in areas where exposure to vampire bats may occur.","['1 Rabies Section, Viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, and Infectious Disease and Pathology Activity, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,']","C K Warner, S R Zaki, W J Shieh, S G Whitfield, J S Smith, L A Orciari, J H Shaddock, M Niezgoda, C W Wright, C S Goldsmith, D W Sanderlin, P A Yager, C E Rupprecht, ",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10466985

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such case in Latin America. After discovering a bat in his garden at 10 o'clock in the morning, a resident of Ubatuba municipality asked the Zoonosis Control Center team to visit his home. The animal was caught alive on the same day and sent to the Pasteur Institute laboratory, where it was identified as a Desmodus rotundus specimen. Standard tests for rabies diagnosis were carried out (direct immunofluorescence and viral isolation), and the results were positive. The presence of different species of (primarily insectivorous) bats in urban areas represents a serious public health problem. This case, however, is indicative of a much greater risk because the species in question has hematophagous habits, what means this animals has a low energy reserves and, therefore, its need to feed daily.","['1 Ubatuba Zoonosis Control Center, São Paulo, Brazil.']","Claudia Ferraz, Samira Maria Achkar, Ivanete Kotait, ",Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18157407

On the view of the interest on and importance of CoVs in bats the occurrence and molecular characterization of CoV were conducted in bats from Brazil. Findings:
        
      
      Three hundred five enteric contents of 29 bat species were tested using a panCoV nested RT-PCR. Nine specimens were positive and eight was suitable for RdRp gene sequencing. RdRp gene phylogeny showed that all CoVs strains from this study cluster in Alphacoronavirus genus, with one Molossidae and one Phlyllostomidae-CoV specific groups.

466,Antigenic and genetic characterization of rabies virus isolates from Uruguay,"After 25 years without any reported cases of rabies in Uruguay, the northern region of the country experienced an epizootic of bovine paralytic rabies in October 2007. The outbreak affected bovines and equines, and the main source of infection was the bat Desmodus rotundus, the only hematophagous species in the country. From October 2007 to July 2008, 42 bovine, 3 equine and 120 chiropteran samples were submitted to the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for rabies testing. A total of 12 samples (7 bovine, 2 equine and 3 from D. rotundus) were positive by the fluorescent antibody test, and viruses were isolated by the mouse inoculation test. The objective of this study was to compare the antigenic and genetic characteristics of these isolates and three isolates from insectivorous bats from other regions. Antigenic typing using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies identified all 12 viruses as variant 3 (AgV3), a variant associated with D. rotundus. Two isolates from insectivorous bats (Tadarida brasiliensis and Molossus sp.) were characterized as antigenic variant 4 (AgV4) while the third, from Myotis sp., could not be characterized using this panel as its reactivity pattern did not match that of any of the known antigenic variants. Partial N-gene sequences (nt 149-1420) of these isolates were aligned with homologous sequences derived from GenBank by the CLUSTAL/W method and used to build a neighbor-joining distance tree with the Kimura 2-parameter model. All 12 isolates were genetically grouped into the D. rotundus cluster as they shared 100% identity. In the phylogenetic analysis, the three isolates from insectivorous bats segregated into three clusters: one related to T. brasiliensis, one to Myotis sp. and the other to Lasiurus sp., although the isolate associated with the latter came from a Molossus sp. specimen. These results indicate that AgV3 was associated with the outbreak of bovine paralytic rabies in Uruguay. This is the first report of rabies virus having been detected in non-hematophagous bats in this country.","['1 National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, M.C.

468,Studies on antigenic and genomic properties of Brazilian rabies virus isolates,"Despite the recognized stability of rabies virus, differences among isolates from different species have been found. This work was carried out with the aim to identify antigenic and genomic differences in Brazilian rabies virus isolates and to verify whether such alterations would bear any relationship with the different hosts for the virus in nature. For that, 79 Brazilian rabies viruses isolated from different host species and from distinct regions within Brazil were submitted to antigenic characterization with a panel of 11 monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed to lyssavirus antigens and to genomic analyses by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the N gene followed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA). In addition, the nucleotide sequences of part of the N gene (225 bp) of seven isolates, taken as representative of the majority of the viruses under study, were determined. The analyses with the Mabs and RT-PCR/REA allowed the identification of two major groups of variants, the first formed by most isolates of cattle and bats and the second formed by viruses of dog origin. Partial sequencing of the N gene confirmed the similarity among isolates from cattle origin and those of vampire bats. However, viruses from non-haematophagous bats exhibited consistent differences from those of vampire bat isolates. Such findings suggest that the variants have evolved fairly stable modifications, which are not altered after passage in a dead-end host of a distinct species. No association could be established between antigenic or genomic alterations and geographic distribution of the isolates, which suggests that evolution of the virus has been directed to adaptation to the host species.","['1 Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa Suínos e Aves), BR 153, Km 110, Vila Tamanduá, Concórdia, SC 89700-000, Brazil.']","R Schaefer, H B R Batista, A C Franco, F A M Rijsewijk, P M Roehe, ",Veterinary microbiology,2005,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15863275

However, an analysis of the putative amino acid sequences were shown to have some characteristic mutations between some reservoir species of Brazil, indicating that there was positive selection in the RNA polymerase L gene of Rabies virus. On comparing the putative viral sequences obtained from the Brazilian isolates and other Lyssavirus, it was determined that amino acid mutations occurred in low-restriction areas. This study of the L gene of Rabies virus is the first to be conducted with samples of virus isolates from Brazil, and the results obtained will help in the determination of the phylogenetic relations of the virus.","['1 Pasteur Institute, Av.

Virome studies in bats distributed in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America have increased dramatically over the past decade, whereas information on viruses infecting South American species is scarce. We explored the virome of Tadarida brasiliensis, an insectivorous New World bat species inhabiting a maternity colony in Rosario (Argentina), by a metagenomic approach. The analysis of five pooled oral/anal swab samples indicated the presence of 43 different taxonomic viral families infecting a wide range of hosts. By conventional nucleic acid detection techniques and/or bioinformatics approaches, the genomes of two novel viruses were completely covered clustering into the Papillomaviridae (Tadarida brasiliensis papillomavirus type 1, TbraPV1) and Genomoviridae (Tadarida brasiliensis gemykibivirus 1, TbGkyV1) families. TbraPV1 is the first papillomavirus type identified in this host and the prototype of a novel genus. TbGkyV1 is the first genomovirus reported in New World bats and constitutes a new species within the genus Gemykibivirus. Our findings extend the knowledge about oral/anal viromes of a South American bat species and contribute to understand the evolution and genetic diversity of the novel characterized viruses.","['1 Grupo Virología Humana, Instituto de Biología Molecular y Celular de Rosario (CONICET).

The combined sensitivity and robustness of the TaqMan RT-PCR assays (qRT-PCR) have made these methods a valuable alternative for rabies virus (RABV) detection.

A total of 44 samples obtained from bats, dogs, cattle, and horses, that were previously tested for rabies by FAT and conventional RT-PCR, were used in the study. All variants were successfully detected by the pan-lyssavirus LN34 qRT-PCR assay. The LysGT1 assay failed to detect three bat-related variants. We further sequenced the region targeted by LysGT1 and demonstrated that the presence of three or more mismatches with respect to the primers and probe sequences precludes viral detection. We conclude that the LysGT1 assay is prone to yield variant-dependent false-negative test results, and in consequence, the LN34 assay would ensure more effective detection of RABV in Argentina.","['1 Instituto de Zoonosis ""Luis Pasteur"", Av.

      Bats are an important ecological group within ecosystems. The rabies virus is a Lyssavirus, and haematophagous bats are the principal reservoir; however, the virus has also been detected in non-haematophagous bats. The objective was to determine the rabies virus in non-haematophagous bats in the Colombian Caribbean region. Methods:
        
      
      In 2017, a cross-sectional study was carried out with a base-risk sampling in twelve geographic zones of the Colombian Caribbean area that included the main ecosystems of two departments. 286 bats were captured, which were euthanized with a pharmacological treatment following the ethical protocols of animal experimentation. The taxonomic identification was done with dichotomous keys. The necropsy was carried out at the capture site, and brain samples were kept in liquid nitrogen. The extraction of the RNA was carried out from the frozen brains with Trizol™; a fragment of 914 bp of the glycoprotein G of the rabies virus was amplified with RT-PCR.

In order to derive phylogenetic relationships between rabies viruses isolated in these three areas, 902 nt cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domain of protein G and a fragment of protein L were obtained by RT-PCR. These amplicons contained the G-L intergenic region and were sequenced to draw phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic analysis showed three distinct groups of viruses in the study sample. Colombian genetic variant I viruses were isolated in both Arauca and the Central Region. These viruses are apparently extinct in Colombia. Colombian genetic variant II viruses were isolated in the Caribbean Region and are still being transmitted in that area. The third group of viruses consists of viruses isolated from two insectivorous bats, three domestic dogs and a human. According to sequence analysis, the data here indicate that the isolates in this third group are bat rabies virus variants. This finding is the first that associates bats to rabies in Colombian dogs and humans, showing an unsuspected vector threatening animal and public health.","['1 Departamento de Ciencias Básicas, Universidad de LaSalle, Bogotá, Colombia.', '2 Laboratorio de Virología, Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), Av.

476,Antigenic and molecular characterization of rabies virus in Argentina,"The nucleoprotein genes of 54 human, domestic and wild animals rabies isolates obtained in Argentina between 1995 and 2002 were characterized using monoclonal antibodies and partial gene sequence analysis. The antigenic and genetic diversities of rabies virus in samples from bat and bat-related cases were studied, leading to the identification of five distinct genetic variants. Rabies viruses isolated from vampire bat related cases were very similar to each other, showing 98.9% overall similarity. Specific antigenic variants (AgV) were detected associated with different insectivorous bats species, in samples from Tadarida brasiliensis and Eumops patagonicus bats. In contrast, isolates from Myotis sp. and Histiotus sp. bats could not be matched to any antigenic type. Additionally, bat rabies cases were also detected in southern provinces previously considered rabies-free. Finally, two independent antigenic and genetic variants co-circulating in northern Argentina were found in isolates obtained from dogs and dog-related cases, suggesting two independent cycles of virus transmission. This is the first national coordinated study of antigenic as well as molecular epidemiology of rabies in Argentina. The information presented here will improve our knowledge about rabies epidemiology and therefore, will assist preventing fatal human cases.","['1 Servicio de Neurovirosis, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Infecciosas, ANLIS Dr. Carlos G.

477,Molecular epidemiology of rabies in Colombia 1994-2005 based on partial nucleoprotein gene sequences,"One hundred and twenty-four rabies viruses (RABV) were isolated from humans and eight species of mammals in Colombia during 1994-2005. To determine the genetic and reservoir-associated diversity cDNA fragments encoding 88 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the nucleoprotein were sequenced and used in phylogenetic analyses. Eight genetic lineages (GL) were characterized. GL1, GL2 and GL3 consisted of dog-associated antigenic variant (AV) 1 RABV, isolated in the centre-east, north and southwest of Colombia, respectively. GL1 is apparently extinct in Colombia. The GL4 were AV3, AV8 and non-determined (ND) AV viruses associated with hematophagous bats. The GL5 and GL6 consisted of AV4 viruses. GL6 isolate was found associated with Tadarida brasiliensis bats. GL5 segregated independently. The GL7 and GL8 segregated independently within clades associated with colonial insectivorous and solitary bats, respectively. Both of these were represented by NDAV viruses. Viruses isolated from humans grouped within GL2, GL3 and GL4, which in turn corresponded to AV1, 3, 8 and ND. Dogs and D. rotundus are the two major rabies reservoirs and vectors in Colombia. Insectivorous bats may also be important rabies reservoirs but spillovers to other species are rare. Our data were consistent with previous studies in which partial Psi, G and L gene sequences were analyzed. Our results confirmed the existence of RABV of unclassified AV in Colombia.","['1 Laboratorio de Virología, Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), Av.

478,Bioecological Drivers of Rabies Virus Circulation in a Neotropical Bat Community,"Introduction:
        
      
      In addition to the commonly accepted importance of the vampire bat in the maintenance and transmission of the rabies virus (RABV) in South America, RABV infection of other species is widely evidenced, challenging their role in the viral cycle. Methodology / principles findings:
        
      
      To identify the bioecological drivers of RABV circulation in neotropical bat communities, we conducted a molecular and serological survey on almost 1,000 bats from 30 species, and a 4-year longitudinal survey in two colonies of vampire bats in French Guiana. RABV was molecularly detected in a common vampire and in a frugivorous bat. The sequences corresponded to haematophagous bat-related strains and were close to viruses circulating in the Brazilian Amazon region. Species' seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 20%, and the risk of seropositivity was higher in bats with a haematophagous diet, living in monospecific colonies and in dense forests. The longitudinal survey showed substantial temporal fluctuations, with individual waves of seroconversions and waning immunity. The high prevalences observed in bat communities, in most habitats and in species that do not share the same microhabitats and bioecological patterns, the temporal variations, and a rather short period of detectable antibodies as observed in recaptured vampires suggest (i) frequent exposure of animals, (ii) an ability of the infected host to control and eliminate the virus, (iii) more relaxed modes of exposure between bats than the commonly assumed infection via direct contact with saliva of infected animals, all of which should be further investigated. Conclusions / significance:
        
      
      We hypothesize that RABV circulation in French Guiana is mainly maintained in the pristine forest habitats that may provide sufficient food resources to allow vampire bats, the main prevalent species, to survive and RABV to be propagated. However, on the forest edge and in disturbed areas, human activities may induce more insidious effects such as defaunation. One of the ecological consequences is the disappearance of resources for tertiary or secondary consumers. Populations of vampires may then shift to alternative resources such as cattle, domestic animals and humans. Therefore, a good forest status, allowing both a dilution effect in highly rich bat communities and the maintenance of large populations of medium-sized and large mammals used as prey by vampires, should prevent their migration to anthropized areas.","['1 Laboratoire des Interactions Virus-Hôtes, Institut Pasteur de la Guyane, Cayenne, French Guiana.', '2 Lyssavirus Dynamics and Host adaptation Unit, National Reference Centre for Rabies, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', '3 Sylvétude, Office National des Forêts, Cayenne, French Guiana.', '4 Laboratoire de Biométrie et Biologie évolutive, UMR CNRS 5558, Université Lyon 1 / CNRS, Villeurbanne, France.']","Benoit de Thoisy, Hervé Bourhy, Marguerite Delaval, Dominique Pontier, Laurent Dacheux, Edith Darcissac, Damien Donato, Amandine Guidez, Florence Larrous, Rachel Lavenir, Arielle Salmier, Vincent Lacoste, Anne Lavergne, ",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2016,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26808820
479,High diversity of rabies viruses associated with insectivorous bats in Argentina: presence of several independent enzootics,"Background:
        
      
      Rabies is a fatal infection of the central nervous system primarily transmitted by rabid animal bites. Rabies virus (RABV) circulates through two different epidemiological cycles: terrestrial and aerial, where dogs, foxes or skunks and bats, respectively, act as the most relevant reservoirs and/or vectors. It is widely accepted that insectivorous bats are not important vectors of RABV in Argentina despite the great diversity of bat species and the extensive Argentinean territory. Methods:
        
      
      We studied the positivity rate of RABV detection in different areas of the country, and the antigenic and genetic diversity of 99 rabies virus (RABV) strains obtained from 14 species of insectivorous bats collected in Argentina between 1991 and 2008. Results:
        
      
      Based on the analysis of bats received for RABV analysis by the National Rabies system of surveillance, the positivity rate of RABV in insectivorous bats ranged from 3.1 to 5.4%, depending on the geographic location. The findings were distributed among an extensive area of the Argentinean territory. The 99 strains of insectivorous bat-related sequences were divided into six distinct lineages associated with Tadarida brasiliensis, Myotis spp, Eptesicus spp, Histiotus montanus, Lasiurus blosseviilli and Lasiurus cinereus. Comparison with RABV sequences obtained from insectivorous bats of the Americas revealed co-circulation of similar genetic variants in several countries. Finally, inter-species transmission, mostly related with Lasiurus species, was demonstrated in 11.8% of the samples. Conclusions:
        
      
      This study demonstrates the presence of several independent enzootics of rabies in insectivorous bats of Argentina. This information is relevant to identify potential areas at risk for human and animal infection.","['1 Servicio de Neurovirosis, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud Dr. Carlos G.

480,Signalling crosstalk during early tumorigenesis in the absence of Polycomb silencing,"In response to stress and injury a coordinated activation of conserved signalling modules, such as JNK and JAK/STAT, is critical to trigger regenerative tissue restoration. While these pathways rebuild homeostasis and promote faithful organ recovery, it is intriguing that they also become activated in various tumour conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how similar pathways can achieve context-dependent functional outputs, likely depending on cellular states. Compromised chromatin regulation, upon removal of the Polycomb group member polyhomeotic, leads to tumour formation with ectopic activation of JNK signalling, mediated by egr/grnd, in addition to JAK/STAT and Notch. Employing quantitative analyses, we show that blocking ectopic signalling impairs ph tumour growth. Furthermore, JAK/STAT functions in parallel to JNK, while Notch relies on JNK. Here, we reveal a signalling hierarchy in ph tumours that is distinct from the regenerative processes regulated by these pathways. Absence of ph renders a permissive state for expression of target genes, but our results suggest that both loss of repression and the presence of activators may collectively regulate gene expression during tumorigenesis. Further dissecting the effect of signalling, developmental or stress-induced factors will thus elucidate the regulation of physiological responses and the contribution of context-specific cellular states.","['1 ETH Zürich, Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, MattenstrasseBasel, Switzerland.', '2 Faculty of Science, University of Basel, KlingelbergstrasseBasel, Switzerland.']","Jorge V Beira, Joana Torres, Renato Paro, ",PLoS genetics,2018,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29357360
481,Phylodynamics of vampire bat-transmitted rabies in Argentina,"Common vampire bat populations distributed from Mexico to Argentina are important rabies reservoir hosts in Latin America. The aim of this work was to analyse the population structure of the rabies virus (RABV) variants associated with vampire bats in the Americas and to study their phylodynamic pattern within Argentina. The phylogenetic analysis based on all available vampire bat-related N gene sequences showed both a geographical and a temporal structure. The two largest groups of RABV variants from Argentina were isolated from northwestern Argentina and from the central western zone of northeastern Argentina, corresponding to livestock areas with different climatic, topographic and biogeographical conditions, which determined their dissemination and evolutionary patterns. In addition, multiple introductions of the infection into Argentina, possibly from Brazil, were detected. The phylodynamic analysis suggests that RABV transmission dynamics is characterized by initial epizootic waves followed by local enzootic cycles with variable persistence. Anthropogenic interventions in the ecosystem should be assessed taking into account not only the environmental impact but also the potential risk of disease spreading through dissemination of current RABV lineages or the emergence of novel ones associated with vampire bats.","['1 Cátedra de Virología, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquímica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Junin 956, 4° piso, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires C1113AAD, Argentina.', '2 CONICET, Av.
